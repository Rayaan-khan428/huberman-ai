off use code "Huberman" checkout. Today discussing depression.
particular, going talk major depression. phrase major depression
used distinguish one form depression other, one bipolar
depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder, really
characterized manic highs. people aren't sleeping talking
fast, buying things pursuing resources can't afford,
starting relationships left right, manic, followed periods crashes
feeling low, lethargic, on. Bipolar depression absolutely crucial thing
us discuss. therefore going entire separate episode related
bipolar depression. Today, going talk major depression, also sometimes
called unipolar depression, just doesn't highs lows.
characterized lows. going talk biology, psychology,
various treatments, behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, that.
go forward material, just want emphasize discussion
mood disorders carries particular sensitivity, sensitivity one related
self-diagnosis. Today's episode, indeed future episodes month
mood disorders, going hear various symptomologies used diagnose
characterize disorders. recognize symptomologies
others know, important thing take note of. However,
accurate diagnosis really done qualified healthcare professional.
saying, keep eyes ears things sound familiar
might concern. time, saying don't necessarily leap
conclusions. Take flags concern bring qualified


healthcare professional, able properly diagnose
particular mood disorder diagnose somebody particular mood disorder
not. essential step. don't say protect us, said really protect
you. Okay, fact-based discussion depression. promise
don't know certain things depression, will clear tell you. fact,
going talk treatments depression looking
promising, right now actually used more. read
mechanistic literature, still bit dark work.
actually common theme medicine. Many times treatments seem
promising look really terrific. isn't lot understanding
mechanism. However, good discussion neuroscience particular
mood disorders, get mechanisms. going that.
that, going frame discussion tools keep depression bay
deal happen find depressed, know
somebody else depressed. thing call depression?
mentioned before, two forms, bipolar depression, not talking
today, major depression, also called unipolar depression other. Major
depression impacts 5% population. enormous number. means
class 100 people, five dealing major depression
point. Look around environment can sure good
portion people surrounded impacted depression, will
point. something really take seriously want
understand. number four cause disability. lot people miss work, miss
school, likely perform poorly work school due major depression.
Now serious challenge discussion depression
relates directly challenges diagnosing depression. Earlier, episode
Dr. Karl Deisseroth, indeed medical doctor PhD. psychiatrist.
made important point, field psychiatry psychology
confronted challenge, trying understand going within
stuff brains deep skulls. don't access
without brain imaging electrodes things like that. Someone just comes
office dissection tool depression speak language. order
determine somebody depression not, use language, talk
things, also carry body. Also general patterns health.


talk depression way clinicians talk depression, one
issues use word depression loosely. lot people say, "Oh,
depressed. "I didn't get job depressed. "I just don't know, really
rough week "or exhausted. "I'm depressed depressed "I thought
going go vacation "and canceled flight." Okay. not clinical
depression. called bummed out, sad disappointed. Now
person might depressed, clinical depression actually specific
criteria. criteria mainly characterized presence certain things
absence particular things. talk things present
somebody major depression. First all, tends lot grief.
tends lot sadness. no surprise. threshold cry often signature
depression. Now doesn't mean cry easily, depressed.
people cry easily others, somebody typically didn't cry easily
suddenly find crying easily, sign depression.
want emphasize, could. also thing call anhedonia, general
lack ability enjoy things, things typically previously enjoyed. Things like
food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, kind lack
enjoyment things. Sometimes lack enjoyment sad, sometimes
just flat, just kind neutral. doesn't feel good nothing there. like
bland food. like experiences analogous biting favorite article
food just not tasting good. just doesn't taste like anything all.
common symptom major depression. one guilt. Oftentimes people
depression will feel guilty things done past, just
generally feel badly themselves. going talk
relates serious symptomology seen depression sometimes,
things like self harm, mutilation, even suicide. time being, want frame
anhedonia, lack ability achieve experience pleasure, kind flat
affect called.

00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation

Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, particular anti-
self confabulation. anti-self confabulation? Well, first all, confabulation
incredible aspect mind nervous system. sometimes see forms


confabulation people memory deficits either brain
damage age-related dementia. good example someone
age related dementia sometimes will find location house
not know got there. ask them, "Oh, here?"
will create elaborate stories. "Oh, thinking going shopping
today, "and going take bus, "and going this." create
elaborate stories, confabulate. yet person hasn't left house
weeks person doesn't driver's license. really just creating
stuff. not lying get anything, confabulating. brain
circuit writes stories, just starts generating content. major depression,
often state delusional anti-self confabulation, confabulation not
directly completely linked reality, ones make self, person
describing them, seem sick way not well. good example
somebody experiences physical injury perhaps. Maybe break ankle,
maybe athlete, also happen become depressed. talk
say, "How things going? "How's rehab though?" go, "Oh,
okay. don't know. "I feel like getting weaker weaker day. "I'm just
not performing well." talk person working with,
kinesiologist whoever physical therapist is. say, "No, actually
really improving. "And tell improving, "but somehow not seeing
improvement, "they're not registering improvement." notice sometimes
subtle sometimes severe, start confabulating. say, "I actually
heard much better. "You're getting better, taking multiple trips
"around building now "before barely get bed." say, "Yeah,
well basically, changed things "about parking lot make easier
move around. "So not really me." aren't people just explaining
away accomplishments 'cause trying brush off praise. viewing
confabulating according view self-deprecating
point doesn't match reality. not people see
actually not matched reality. symptom depression think
don't often think conceptualize enough. not just telling people, "oh yeah,
not good seems. Everything's bad." people really believe
becomes disconnected reality. sort sinking pit
losing touch realities world, including data themselves, ability


move get around it,

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,
be, just worn out. don't energy had. not
heads, probably, now think good data support fact
something off, something disrupted autonomic so-called vegetative
nervous system. one common symptoms people major
depression, one signs major depression early waking not able
fall back asleep despite exhausted. waking 3:00 4:00 5:00
just spontaneously not able go back sleep. want emphasize
happen reasons well, common symptom warning sign
major depression. talk sleep depression. well-known
architecture sleep disrupted depression. architecture sleep?
done entire episodes this, briefly two sentences, although
probably run sentences, early night, tend slow wave sleep
REM sleep Rapid Eye Movement sleep. night goes on, tend
Rapid Eye Movement sleep. architecture slow wave sleep preceding Rapid
Eye Movement sleep radically disrupted major depression. addition, pattern
activity brain particular phases sleep disrupted. Now
sleep. can't people creating situation themselves.
real physiological signs something off so-called autonomic vegetative
nervous system. things relate autonomic


nervous system, normally think voluntary nature.
things like decreased appetite. can imagine one decreased
appetite anhedonia, lack pleasure food, right? don't
enjoy food, might less motivated eat it. makes sense. well
disruptions autonomic nervous system, vegetative
symptoms, called, can imagine someone decreased
appetite hormones associated appetite, hypocretin orexin
things sort, ghrelin, will disrupted. names hypocretin
orexin ghrelin don't make sense you, don't worry it. just
hormones impact eat, feel hungry, crave food
more, well feel full, enough so-called satiety. want learn
those, entire episodes eating metabolism. can see
symptomology major depression impacts us multiple levels.
conscious level excited generally. Well, reduced. grief,
guilt, crying, also vegetative things.
disruptions sleep, course make everything challenging
awake. know sleep vital resetting. waking early, can't get
back sleep. going adjust affect, emotions negative ways.
know this. appetite off. hormones get disrupted. cortisol
levels increased. particular, signature pattern depression whereby
cortisol, stress hormone normally released healthy way early
part day shifted late day. fact, 9:00 PM peak cortisol one
physiological signatures depressive like states. not one,
important one. lot things going major depression. now
probably thinking, goodness, dreadful. Like terrible stuff.
indeed terrible. terrible thing find oneself mode things feel sad,
feel guilty, exhausted. oftentimes also association
anxiety system. just people exhausted lethargic don't
enjoy things, doesn't necessarily mean absence anxiety. can
also lot anxiety going happen me. going able
achieve goals life? Will ever get state? things really start
layer on. sounds depressing you, indeed depressing. really
place many people find themselves. pit just don't know
climb of.



00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know
depression underlying chemistry people there. like

00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol

certainly go depth. really sets stage
headed next. next like talk hormones relate
depression. also like talk stress relates depression, well
talk genetics predispositions depression.
thinking, hey, want tools. want know fix depression.
understand desire that. will just ask hang little bit longer,
not will learn lot complicated mood disorder works,
interesting things it, will also position get lot
tools will describe. always option skip forward course,
think important understand hormonal stress-related aspects
depression. talk hormones. 20% people major depression

thyroid medication increase thyroid output people depressed will

dopamine, norepinephrine substance abuse. Sometimes thyroid problem.
certain situations conditions can impact thyroid hormone system
make people susceptible depression make pre-existing depression
worse. things like childbirth. well-known women give birth
can often undergo called postpartum depression. actually comes word
post parturition depression. give birth, happier, joyful
birth new healthy child, will lapse depression. thought
hormonally related, either directly thyroid system perhaps cortisol

certain phases menstrual cycle experience symptoms much like
clinical depression, oftentimes diagnosed clinical depression appropriately.
course menstrual cycle associated shifts hormone levels. well,
menopausal post-menopausal women susceptible major depression,
regardless whether not major depression earlier life.
things lookout definitely talk doctor get blood
panel hopefully includes measures thyroid hormone cortisol hormone.
cortisol hormone? Well stress correlated bouts major depression
across lifespan. many bouts? Well, turns go one
two three, well, hit four five bouts really intense, stressful episodes
life, tend long-term stressful episodes, risk major depression goes
way up. whether not genetic predisposition depression not, one
best things can try avoid getting depressed learn control
stress system, not go short-term stress, everybody experiences,
short-term stressors, medium term stress long-term stress, not

way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can

depressed. stress system associated release
cortisol. cortisol system can dramatically impact way different
neuromodulators, dopamine, norepinephrine serotonin function.
kind latent longer lasting impact systems impact mood wellbeing.
learning control stress really key. not depressed
somebody not lapsed depression recently, take control stress
system. entire episode conquer stress,

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want
imagine very, shallow hill, like mellow hill. just ramp set

serious stress, trying finish degree relationship breakup,
family member sick, loss loved one pet, stress,
probability will experience major depression goes up. However,
carry gene, HTTLPR gene, steepness curve goes way, way


actually like line need far fewer bouts stress order lapse
major depression, okay? typical person doesn't carry
polymorphism experience two three four five bouts stress
lapse depression, somebody gene susceptible getting depression
just one two bouts intense stress, okay? genes

many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not
can follow recipe, also gives flexibility salt isn't
available, want adjust flavor dish, want try

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2

Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective

therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high

euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort

instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

off use code "Huberman" checkout. Today discussing depression.
particular, going talk major depression. phrase major depression
used distinguish one form depression other, one bipolar
depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder, really
characterized manic highs. people aren't sleeping talking
fast, buying things pursuing resources can't afford,
starting relationships left right, manic, followed periods crashes
feeling low, lethargic, on. Bipolar depression absolutely crucial thing
us discuss. therefore going entire separate episode related
bipolar depression. Today, going talk major depression, also sometimes
called unipolar depression, just doesn't highs lows.
characterized lows. going talk biology, psychology,
various treatments, behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, that.
go forward material, just want emphasize discussion
mood disorders carries particular sensitivity, sensitivity one related
self-diagnosis. Today's episode, indeed future episodes month
mood disorders, going hear various symptomologies used diagnose
characterize disorders. recognize symptomologies
others know, important thing take note of. However,
accurate diagnosis really done qualified healthcare professional.
saying, keep eyes ears things sound familiar
might concern. time, saying don't necessarily leap
conclusions. Take flags concern bring qualified


healthcare professional, able properly diagnose
particular mood disorder diagnose somebody particular mood disorder
not. essential step. don't say protect us, said really protect
you. Okay, fact-based discussion depression. promise
don't know certain things depression, will clear tell you. fact,
going talk treatments depression looking
promising, right now actually used more. read
mechanistic literature, still bit dark work.
actually common theme medicine. Many times treatments seem
promising look really terrific. isn't lot understanding
mechanism. However, good discussion neuroscience particular
mood disorders, get mechanisms. going that.
that, going frame discussion tools keep depression bay
deal happen find depressed, know
somebody else depressed. thing call depression?
mentioned before, two forms, bipolar depression, not talking
today, major depression, also called unipolar depression other. Major
depression impacts 5% population. enormous number. means
class 100 people, five dealing major depression
point. Look around environment can sure good
portion people surrounded impacted depression, will
point. something really take seriously want
understand. number four cause disability. lot people miss work, miss
school, likely perform poorly work school due major depression.
Now serious challenge discussion depression
relates directly challenges diagnosing depression. Earlier, episode
Dr. Karl Deisseroth, indeed medical doctor PhD. psychiatrist.
made important point, field psychiatry psychology
confronted challenge, trying understand going within
stuff brains deep skulls. don't access
without brain imaging electrodes things like that. Someone just comes
office dissection tool depression speak language. order
determine somebody depression not, use language, talk
things, also carry body. Also general patterns health.


talk depression way clinicians talk depression, one
issues use word depression loosely. lot people say, "Oh,
depressed. "I didn't get job depressed. "I just don't know, really
rough week "or exhausted. "I'm depressed depressed "I thought
going go vacation "and canceled flight." Okay. not clinical
depression. called bummed out, sad disappointed. Now
person might depressed, clinical depression actually specific
criteria. criteria mainly characterized presence certain things
absence particular things. talk things present
somebody major depression. First all, tends lot grief.
tends lot sadness. no surprise. threshold cry often signature
depression. Now doesn't mean cry easily, depressed.
people cry easily others, somebody typically didn't cry easily
suddenly find crying easily, sign depression.
want emphasize, could. also thing call anhedonia, general
lack ability enjoy things, things typically previously enjoyed. Things like
food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, kind lack
enjoyment things. Sometimes lack enjoyment sad, sometimes
just flat, just kind neutral. doesn't feel good nothing there. like
bland food. like experiences analogous biting favorite article
food just not tasting good. just doesn't taste like anything all.
common symptom major depression. one guilt. Oftentimes people
depression will feel guilty things done past, just
generally feel badly themselves. going talk
relates serious symptomology seen depression sometimes,
things like self harm, mutilation, even suicide. time being, want frame
anhedonia, lack ability achieve experience pleasure, kind flat
affect called.

00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation

Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, particular anti-
self confabulation. anti-self confabulation? Well, first all, confabulation
incredible aspect mind nervous system. sometimes see forms


confabulation people memory deficits either brain
damage age-related dementia. good example someone
age related dementia sometimes will find location house
not know got there. ask them, "Oh, here?"
will create elaborate stories. "Oh, thinking going shopping
today, "and going take bus, "and going this." create
elaborate stories, confabulate. yet person hasn't left house
weeks person doesn't driver's license. really just creating
stuff. not lying get anything, confabulating. brain
circuit writes stories, just starts generating content. major depression,
often state delusional anti-self confabulation, confabulation not
directly completely linked reality, ones make self, person
describing them, seem sick way not well. good example
somebody experiences physical injury perhaps. Maybe break ankle,
maybe athlete, also happen become depressed. talk
say, "How things going? "How's rehab though?" go, "Oh,
okay. don't know. "I feel like getting weaker weaker day. "I'm just
not performing well." talk person working with,
kinesiologist whoever physical therapist is. say, "No, actually
really improving. "And tell improving, "but somehow not seeing
improvement, "they're not registering improvement." notice sometimes
subtle sometimes severe, start confabulating. say, "I actually
heard much better. "You're getting better, taking multiple trips
"around building now "before barely get bed." say, "Yeah,
well basically, changed things "about parking lot make easier
move around. "So not really me." aren't people just explaining
away accomplishments 'cause trying brush off praise. viewing
confabulating according view self-deprecating
point doesn't match reality. not people see
actually not matched reality. symptom depression think
don't often think conceptualize enough. not just telling people, "oh yeah,
not good seems. Everything's bad." people really believe
becomes disconnected reality. sort sinking pit
losing touch realities world, including data themselves, ability


move get around it,

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,
be, just worn out. don't energy had. not
heads, probably, now think good data support fact
something off, something disrupted autonomic so-called vegetative
nervous system. one common symptoms people major
depression, one signs major depression early waking not able
fall back asleep despite exhausted. waking 3:00 4:00 5:00
just spontaneously not able go back sleep. want emphasize
happen reasons well, common symptom warning sign
major depression. talk sleep depression. well-known
architecture sleep disrupted depression. architecture sleep?
done entire episodes this, briefly two sentences, although
probably run sentences, early night, tend slow wave sleep
REM sleep Rapid Eye Movement sleep. night goes on, tend
Rapid Eye Movement sleep. architecture slow wave sleep preceding Rapid
Eye Movement sleep radically disrupted major depression. addition, pattern
activity brain particular phases sleep disrupted. Now
sleep. can't people creating situation themselves.
real physiological signs something off so-called autonomic vegetative
nervous system. things relate autonomic


nervous system, normally think voluntary nature.
things like decreased appetite. can imagine one decreased
appetite anhedonia, lack pleasure food, right? don't
enjoy food, might less motivated eat it. makes sense. well
disruptions autonomic nervous system, vegetative
symptoms, called, can imagine someone decreased
appetite hormones associated appetite, hypocretin orexin
things sort, ghrelin, will disrupted. names hypocretin
orexin ghrelin don't make sense you, don't worry it. just
hormones impact eat, feel hungry, crave food
more, well feel full, enough so-called satiety. want learn
those, entire episodes eating metabolism. can see
symptomology major depression impacts us multiple levels.
conscious level excited generally. Well, reduced. grief,
guilt, crying, also vegetative things.
disruptions sleep, course make everything challenging
awake. know sleep vital resetting. waking early, can't get
back sleep. going adjust affect, emotions negative ways.
know this. appetite off. hormones get disrupted. cortisol
levels increased. particular, signature pattern depression whereby
cortisol, stress hormone normally released healthy way early
part day shifted late day. fact, 9:00 PM peak cortisol one
physiological signatures depressive like states. not one,
important one. lot things going major depression. now
probably thinking, goodness, dreadful. Like terrible stuff.
indeed terrible. terrible thing find oneself mode things feel sad,
feel guilty, exhausted. oftentimes also association
anxiety system. just people exhausted lethargic don't
enjoy things, doesn't necessarily mean absence anxiety. can
also lot anxiety going happen me. going able
achieve goals life? Will ever get state? things really start
layer on. sounds depressing you, indeed depressing. really
place many people find themselves. pit just don't know
climb of.



00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know

00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol

certainly go depth. really sets stage
headed next. next like talk hormones relate
depression. also like talk stress relates depression, well
talk genetics predispositions depression.
thinking, hey, want tools. want know fix depression.
understand desire that. will just ask hang little bit longer,
not will learn lot complicated mood disorder works,
interesting things it, will also position get lot
tools will describe. always option skip forward course,
think important understand hormonal stress-related aspects
depression. talk hormones. 20% people major depression

thyroid medication increase thyroid output people depressed will

dopamine, norepinephrine substance abuse. Sometimes thyroid problem.
certain situations conditions can impact thyroid hormone system
make people susceptible depression make pre-existing depression
worse. things like childbirth. well-known women give birth
can often undergo called postpartum depression. actually comes word
post parturition depression. give birth, happier, joyful
birth new healthy child, will lapse depression. thought
hormonally related, either directly thyroid system perhaps cortisol

certain phases menstrual cycle experience symptoms much like
clinical depression, oftentimes diagnosed clinical depression appropriately.
course menstrual cycle associated shifts hormone levels. well,
menopausal post-menopausal women susceptible major depression,
regardless whether not major depression earlier life.
things lookout definitely talk doctor get blood
panel hopefully includes measures thyroid hormone cortisol hormone.
cortisol hormone? Well stress correlated bouts major depression
across lifespan. many bouts? Well, turns go one
two three, well, hit four five bouts really intense, stressful episodes
life, tend long-term stressful episodes, risk major depression goes
way up. whether not genetic predisposition depression not, one
best things can try avoid getting depressed learn control
stress system, not go short-term stress, everybody experiences,
short-term stressors, medium term stress long-term stress, not

way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can

depressed. stress system associated release
cortisol. cortisol system can dramatically impact way different
neuromodulators, dopamine, norepinephrine serotonin function.
kind latent longer lasting impact systems impact mood wellbeing.
learning control stress really key. not depressed
somebody not lapsed depression recently, take control stress

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want
imagine very, shallow hill, like mellow hill. just ramp set

serious stress, trying finish degree relationship breakup,
family member sick, loss loved one pet, stress,
probability will experience major depression goes up. However,
carry gene, HTTLPR gene, steepness curve goes way, way


actually like line need far fewer bouts stress order lapse
major depression, okay? typical person doesn't carry
polymorphism experience two three four five bouts stress
lapse depression, somebody gene susceptible getting depression
just one two bouts intense stress, okay? genes

many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus

good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release

process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause

Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

particular, going talk major depression. phrase major depression
used distinguish one form depression other, one bipolar
depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder, really
characterized manic highs. people aren't sleeping talking
fast, buying things pursuing resources can't afford,
starting relationships left right, manic, followed periods crashes
feeling low, lethargic, on. Bipolar depression absolutely crucial thing
us discuss. therefore going entire separate episode related
bipolar depression. Today, going talk major depression, also sometimes
called unipolar depression, just doesn't highs lows.
characterized lows. going talk biology, psychology,
various treatments, behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, that.
go forward material, just want emphasize discussion
mood disorders carries particular sensitivity, sensitivity one related
self-diagnosis. Today's episode, indeed future episodes month
mood disorders, going hear various symptomologies used diagnose
characterize disorders. recognize symptomologies
others know, important thing take note of. However,
accurate diagnosis really done qualified healthcare professional.
saying, keep eyes ears things sound familiar
might concern. time, saying don't necessarily leap
conclusions. Take flags concern bring qualified


healthcare professional, able properly diagnose
particular mood disorder diagnose somebody particular mood disorder
not. essential step. don't say protect us, said really protect
you. Okay, fact-based discussion depression. promise
don't know certain things depression, will clear tell you. fact,
going talk treatments depression looking
promising, right now actually used more. read
mechanistic literature, still bit dark work.
actually common theme medicine. Many times treatments seem
promising look really terrific. isn't lot understanding
mechanism. However, good discussion neuroscience particular
mood disorders, get mechanisms. going that.
that, going frame discussion tools keep depression bay
deal happen find depressed, know
somebody else depressed. thing call depression?
mentioned before, two forms, bipolar depression, not talking
today, major depression, also called unipolar depression other. Major
depression impacts 5% population. enormous number. means

portion people surrounded impacted depression, will
point. something really take seriously want
understand. number four cause disability. lot people miss work, miss
school, likely perform poorly work school due major depression.
Now serious challenge discussion depression
relates directly challenges diagnosing depression. Earlier, episode
Dr. Karl Deisseroth, indeed medical doctor PhD. psychiatrist.
made important point, field psychiatry psychology
confronted challenge, trying understand going within
stuff brains deep skulls. don't access
without brain imaging electrodes things like that. Someone just comes
office dissection tool depression speak language. order
determine somebody depression not, use language, talk
things, also carry body. Also general patterns health.


talk depression way clinicians talk depression, one
issues use word depression loosely. lot people say, "Oh,
depressed. "I didn't get job depressed. "I just don't know, really
rough week "or exhausted. "I'm depressed depressed "I thought
going go vacation "and canceled flight." Okay. not clinical
depression. called bummed out, sad disappointed. Now
person might depressed, clinical depression actually specific
criteria. criteria mainly characterized presence certain things
absence particular things. talk things present
somebody major depression. First all, tends lot grief.
tends lot sadness. no surprise. threshold cry often signature
depression. Now doesn't mean cry easily, depressed.
people cry easily others, somebody typically didn't cry easily
suddenly find crying easily, sign depression.
want emphasize, could. also thing call anhedonia, general
lack ability enjoy things, things typically previously enjoyed. Things like
food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, kind lack
enjoyment things. Sometimes lack enjoyment sad, sometimes
just flat, just kind neutral. doesn't feel good nothing there. like
bland food. like experiences analogous biting favorite article
food just not tasting good. just doesn't taste like anything all.
common symptom major depression. one guilt. Oftentimes people
depression will feel guilty things done past, just
generally feel badly themselves. going talk
relates serious symptomology seen depression sometimes,
things like self harm, mutilation, even suicide. time being, want frame
anhedonia, lack ability achieve experience pleasure, kind flat
affect called.

00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation

Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, particular anti-
self confabulation. anti-self confabulation? Well, first all, confabulation
incredible aspect mind nervous system. sometimes see forms


confabulation people memory deficits either brain
damage age-related dementia. good example someone
age related dementia sometimes will find location house
not know got there. ask them, "Oh, here?"
will create elaborate stories. "Oh, thinking going shopping
today, "and going take bus, "and going this." create
elaborate stories, confabulate. yet person hasn't left house
weeks person doesn't driver's license. really just creating
stuff. not lying get anything, confabulating. brain
circuit writes stories, just starts generating content. major depression,
often state delusional anti-self confabulation, confabulation not
directly completely linked reality, ones make self, person
describing them, seem sick way not well. good example
somebody experiences physical injury perhaps. Maybe break ankle,
maybe athlete, also happen become depressed. talk
say, "How things going? "How's rehab though?" go, "Oh,
okay. don't know. "I feel like getting weaker weaker day. "I'm just
not performing well." talk person working with,
kinesiologist whoever physical therapist is. say, "No, actually
really improving. "And tell improving, "but somehow not seeing
improvement, "they're not registering improvement." notice sometimes
subtle sometimes severe, start confabulating. say, "I actually
heard much better. "You're getting better, taking multiple trips
"around building now "before barely get bed." say, "Yeah,
well basically, changed things "about parking lot make easier
move around. "So not really me." aren't people just explaining
away accomplishments 'cause trying brush off praise. viewing
confabulating according view self-deprecating
point doesn't match reality. not people see
actually not matched reality. symptom depression think
don't often think conceptualize enough. not just telling people, "oh yeah,
not good seems. Everything's bad." people really believe
becomes disconnected reality. sort sinking pit
losing touch realities world, including data themselves, ability


move get around it,

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,
be, just worn out. don't energy had. not
heads, probably, now think good data support fact
something off, something disrupted autonomic so-called vegetative
nervous system. one common symptoms people major
depression, one signs major depression early waking not able
fall back asleep despite exhausted. waking 3:00 4:00 5:00
just spontaneously not able go back sleep. want emphasize
happen reasons well, common symptom warning sign
major depression. talk sleep depression. well-known
architecture sleep disrupted depression. architecture sleep?
done entire episodes this, briefly two sentences, although
probably run sentences, early night, tend slow wave sleep
REM sleep Rapid Eye Movement sleep. night goes on, tend
Rapid Eye Movement sleep. architecture slow wave sleep preceding Rapid
Eye Movement sleep radically disrupted major depression. addition, pattern
activity brain particular phases sleep disrupted. Now
sleep. can't people creating situation themselves.
real physiological signs something off so-called autonomic vegetative
nervous system. things relate autonomic


nervous system, normally think voluntary nature.
things like decreased appetite. can imagine one decreased
appetite anhedonia, lack pleasure food, right? don't
enjoy food, might less motivated eat it. makes sense. well
disruptions autonomic nervous system, vegetative
symptoms, called, can imagine someone decreased
appetite hormones associated appetite, hypocretin orexin
things sort, ghrelin, will disrupted. names hypocretin
orexin ghrelin don't make sense you, don't worry it. just
hormones impact eat, feel hungry, crave food
more, well feel full, enough so-called satiety. want learn
those, entire episodes eating metabolism. can see
symptomology major depression impacts us multiple levels.
conscious level excited generally. Well, reduced. grief,
guilt, crying, also vegetative things.
disruptions sleep, course make everything challenging
awake. know sleep vital resetting. waking early, can't get
back sleep. going adjust affect, emotions negative ways.
know this. appetite off. hormones get disrupted. cortisol
levels increased. particular, signature pattern depression whereby
cortisol, stress hormone normally released healthy way early
part day shifted late day. fact, 9:00 PM peak cortisol one
physiological signatures depressive like states. not one,
important one. lot things going major depression. now
probably thinking, goodness, dreadful. Like terrible stuff.
indeed terrible. terrible thing find oneself mode things feel sad,
feel guilty, exhausted. oftentimes also association
anxiety system. just people exhausted lethargic don't
enjoy things, doesn't necessarily mean absence anxiety. can
also lot anxiety going happen me. going able
achieve goals life? Will ever get state? things really start
layer on. sounds depressing you, indeed depressing. really
place many people find themselves. pit just don't know
climb of.



00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know
depression underlying chemistry people there. like
learn more, invite pursue searching terms internet.

00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol

certainly go depth. really sets stage
headed next. next like talk hormones relate
depression. also like talk stress relates depression, well
talk genetics predispositions depression.
thinking, hey, want tools. want know fix depression.
understand desire that. will just ask hang little bit longer,
not will learn lot complicated mood disorder works,
interesting things it, will also position get lot
tools will describe. always option skip forward course,
think important understand hormonal stress-related aspects
depression. talk hormones. 20% people major depression
low thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone related metabolism. Oftentimes
think thyroid related fast metabolism, thyroid related
forms metabolism, including ability synthesize new tissues like protein
repair injuries. whole episode thyroid growth hormone. want
check out, archived hubermanlab.com. timestamped, et cetera.


can find YouTube, Apple, Spotify, places. curious
thyroid hormone growth hormone, want deep dive those,
want learn alter levels using various approaches, check out.
20% people major depression hypo thyroidal. don't make enough
thyroid. leads low energy, low metabolism brain body.
condition called Hashimoto's, essentially low thyroid output. again, don't
want get tools related thyroid. Sometimes psychiatrists will prescribe
thyroid medication increase thyroid output people depressed will
work relieve symptoms. isn't necessarily direct problem serotonin,
dopamine, norepinephrine substance abuse. Sometimes thyroid problem.
certain situations conditions can impact thyroid hormone system
make people susceptible depression make pre-existing depression
worse. things like childbirth. well-known women give birth
can often undergo called postpartum depression. actually comes word
post parturition depression. give birth, happier, joyful
birth new healthy child, will lapse depression. thought
hormonally related, either directly thyroid system perhaps cortisol
system well. talk cortisol moment. well, certain women
certain phases menstrual cycle experience symptoms much like
clinical depression, oftentimes diagnosed clinical depression appropriately.
course menstrual cycle associated shifts hormone levels. well,
menopausal post-menopausal women susceptible major depression,
regardless whether not major depression earlier life.
things lookout definitely talk doctor get blood
panel hopefully includes measures thyroid hormone cortisol hormone.
cortisol hormone? Well stress correlated bouts major depression
across lifespan. many bouts? Well, turns go one
two three, well, hit four five bouts really intense, stressful episodes
life, tend long-term stressful episodes, risk major depression goes
way up. whether not genetic predisposition depression not, one
best things can try avoid getting depressed learn control
stress system, not go short-term stress, everybody experiences,
short-term stressors, medium term stress long-term stress, not
many bouts long-term stress probability getting depressed goes


way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can
stressful, sometimes event. months later become
depressed. stress system associated release
cortisol. cortisol system can dramatically impact way different
neuromodulators, dopamine, norepinephrine serotonin function.
kind latent longer lasting impact systems impact mood wellbeing.
learning control stress really key. not depressed
somebody not lapsed depression recently, take control stress
system. entire episode conquer stress,

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want
imagine very, shallow hill, like mellow hill. just ramp set
10 15 degrees, okay. plotting mind
serious stress, trying finish degree relationship breakup,
family member sick, loss loved one pet, stress,
probability will experience major depression goes up. However,
carry gene, HTTLPR gene, steepness curve goes way, way


actually like line need far fewer bouts stress order lapse
major depression, okay? typical person doesn't carry
polymorphism experience two three four five bouts stress
lapse depression, somebody gene susceptible getting depression
just one two bouts intense stress, okay? genes
work. don't preordain determine depressed. raise
susceptibility. many genes, many things related heritability general, work
way. know strong genetic component depression. know?
Well, called concordant monozygotic twins. will identical twins.
can either one biological sack two biological sacks utero,
called monochorionic dichorionic. Well, typically monochorionic.
identical twins, one twins goes major depression,
50% probability one will major depression. not 100%, not
100% inherited, not 100% generic, might say, much higher
predisposition depression. Whereas fraternal twins, number drops,

reasons things work will now make sense adjust things like
serotonin dopamine, adjust specific pathways. know
many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not
can follow recipe, also gives flexibility salt isn't
available, want adjust flavor dish, want try
new dish, want get experimental. understand mechanism, puts

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause

out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

going talk treatments depression looking
promising, right now actually used more. read
mechanistic literature, still bit dark work.
actually common theme medicine. Many times treatments seem

Now serious challenge discussion depression
relates directly challenges diagnosing depression. Earlier, episode
Dr. Karl Deisseroth, indeed medical doctor PhD. psychiatrist.
made important point, field psychiatry psychology
confronted challenge, trying understand going within
stuff brains deep skulls. don't access
without brain imaging electrodes things like that. Someone just comes
office dissection tool depression speak language. order
determine somebody depression not, use language, talk
things, also carry body. Also general patterns health.


talk depression way clinicians talk depression, one
issues use word depression loosely. lot people say, "Oh,
depressed. "I didn't get job depressed. "I just don't know, really
rough week "or exhausted. "I'm depressed depressed "I thought
going go vacation "and canceled flight." Okay. not clinical
depression. called bummed out, sad disappointed. Now
person might depressed, clinical depression actually specific
criteria. criteria mainly characterized presence certain things
absence particular things. talk things present
somebody major depression. First all, tends lot grief.
tends lot sadness. no surprise. threshold cry often signature
depression. Now doesn't mean cry easily, depressed.
people cry easily others, somebody typically didn't cry easily
suddenly find crying easily, sign depression.
want emphasize, could. also thing call anhedonia, general
lack ability enjoy things, things typically previously enjoyed. Things like
food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, kind lack
enjoyment things. Sometimes lack enjoyment sad, sometimes
just flat, just kind neutral. doesn't feel good nothing there. like
bland food. like experiences analogous biting favorite article
food just not tasting good. just doesn't taste like anything all.
common symptom major depression. one guilt. Oftentimes people
depression will feel guilty things done past, just
generally feel badly themselves. going talk
relates serious symptomology seen depression sometimes,
things like self harm, mutilation, even suicide. time being, want frame
anhedonia, lack ability achieve experience pleasure, kind flat
affect called.

00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation

Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, particular anti-
self confabulation. anti-self confabulation? Well, first all, confabulation
incredible aspect mind nervous system. sometimes see forms


confabulation people memory deficits either brain
damage age-related dementia. good example someone
age related dementia sometimes will find location house
not know got there. ask them, "Oh, here?"
will create elaborate stories. "Oh, thinking going shopping
today, "and going take bus, "and going this." create
elaborate stories, confabulate. yet person hasn't left house
weeks person doesn't driver's license. really just creating
stuff. not lying get anything, confabulating. brain
circuit writes stories, just starts generating content. major depression,
often state delusional anti-self confabulation, confabulation not
directly completely linked reality, ones make self, person
describing them, seem sick way not well. good example
somebody experiences physical injury perhaps. Maybe break ankle,
maybe athlete, also happen become depressed. talk
say, "How things going? "How's rehab though?" go, "Oh,
okay. don't know. "I feel like getting weaker weaker day. "I'm just
not performing well." talk person working with,
kinesiologist whoever physical therapist is. say, "No, actually
really improving. "And tell improving, "but somehow not seeing
improvement, "they're not registering improvement." notice sometimes
subtle sometimes severe, start confabulating. say, "I actually
heard much better. "You're getting better, taking multiple trips
"around building now "before barely get bed." say, "Yeah,
well basically, changed things "about parking lot make easier
move around. "So not really me." aren't people just explaining
away accomplishments 'cause trying brush off praise. viewing
confabulating according view self-deprecating
point doesn't match reality. not people see
actually not matched reality. symptom depression think
don't often think conceptualize enough. not just telling people, "oh yeah,
not good seems. Everything's bad." people really believe
becomes disconnected reality. sort sinking pit
losing touch realities world, including data themselves, ability


move get around it,

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,
be, just worn out. don't energy had. not
heads, probably, now think good data support fact
something off, something disrupted autonomic so-called vegetative
nervous system. one common symptoms people major
depression, one signs major depression early waking not able
fall back asleep despite exhausted. waking 3:00 4:00 5:00
just spontaneously not able go back sleep. want emphasize
happen reasons well, common symptom warning sign
major depression. talk sleep depression. well-known
architecture sleep disrupted depression. architecture sleep?
done entire episodes this, briefly two sentences, although
probably run sentences, early night, tend slow wave sleep
REM sleep Rapid Eye Movement sleep. night goes on, tend
Rapid Eye Movement sleep. architecture slow wave sleep preceding Rapid
Eye Movement sleep radically disrupted major depression. addition, pattern
activity brain particular phases sleep disrupted. Now
sleep. can't people creating situation themselves.
real physiological signs something off so-called autonomic vegetative
nervous system. things relate autonomic


nervous system, normally think voluntary nature.
things like decreased appetite. can imagine one decreased
appetite anhedonia, lack pleasure food, right? don't
enjoy food, might less motivated eat it. makes sense. well
disruptions autonomic nervous system, vegetative
symptoms, called, can imagine someone decreased
appetite hormones associated appetite, hypocretin orexin
things sort, ghrelin, will disrupted. names hypocretin
orexin ghrelin don't make sense you, don't worry it. just
hormones impact eat, feel hungry, crave food
more, well feel full, enough so-called satiety. want learn
those, entire episodes eating metabolism. can see
symptomology major depression impacts us multiple levels.
conscious level excited generally. Well, reduced. grief,
guilt, crying, also vegetative things.
disruptions sleep, course make everything challenging
awake. know sleep vital resetting. waking early, can't get
back sleep. going adjust affect, emotions negative ways.
know this. appetite off. hormones get disrupted. cortisol
levels increased. particular, signature pattern depression whereby
cortisol, stress hormone normally released healthy way early
part day shifted late day. fact, 9:00 PM peak cortisol one
physiological signatures depressive like states. not one,
important one. lot things going major depression. now
probably thinking, goodness, dreadful. Like terrible stuff.
indeed terrible. terrible thing find oneself mode things feel sad,
feel guilty, exhausted. oftentimes also association
anxiety system. just people exhausted lethargic don't
enjoy things, doesn't necessarily mean absence anxiety. can
also lot anxiety going happen me. going able
achieve goals life? Will ever get state? things really start
layer on. sounds depressing you, indeed depressing. really
place many people find themselves. pit just don't know
climb of.



00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know
depression underlying chemistry people there. like
learn more, invite pursue searching terms internet.

00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol

certainly go depth. really sets stage
headed next. next like talk hormones relate
depression. also like talk stress relates depression, well
talk genetics predispositions depression.
thinking, hey, want tools. want know fix depression.
understand desire that. will just ask hang little bit longer,
not will learn lot complicated mood disorder works,
interesting things it, will also position get lot
tools will describe. always option skip forward course,
think important understand hormonal stress-related aspects
depression. talk hormones. 20% people major depression
low thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone related metabolism. Oftentimes
think thyroid related fast metabolism, thyroid related
forms metabolism, including ability synthesize new tissues like protein
repair injuries. whole episode thyroid growth hormone. want

want learn alter levels using various approaches, check out.
20% people major depression hypo thyroidal. don't make enough
thyroid. leads low energy, low metabolism brain body.
condition called Hashimoto's, essentially low thyroid output. again, don't
want get tools related thyroid. Sometimes psychiatrists will prescribe
thyroid medication increase thyroid output people depressed will
work relieve symptoms. isn't necessarily direct problem serotonin,
dopamine, norepinephrine substance abuse. Sometimes thyroid problem.
certain situations conditions can impact thyroid hormone system
make people susceptible depression make pre-existing depression
worse. things like childbirth. well-known women give birth
can often undergo called postpartum depression. actually comes word
post parturition depression. give birth, happier, joyful
birth new healthy child, will lapse depression. thought
hormonally related, either directly thyroid system perhaps cortisol

certain phases menstrual cycle experience symptoms much like
clinical depression, oftentimes diagnosed clinical depression appropriately.
course menstrual cycle associated shifts hormone levels. well,
menopausal post-menopausal women susceptible major depression,
regardless whether not major depression earlier life.
things lookout definitely talk doctor get blood
panel hopefully includes measures thyroid hormone cortisol hormone.
cortisol hormone? Well stress correlated bouts major depression
across lifespan. many bouts? Well, turns go one
two three, well, hit four five bouts really intense, stressful episodes
life, tend long-term stressful episodes, risk major depression goes
way up. whether not genetic predisposition depression not, one
best things can try avoid getting depressed learn control
stress system, not go short-term stress, everybody experiences,
short-term stressors, medium term stress long-term stress, not

way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can

depressed. stress system associated release
cortisol. cortisol system can dramatically impact way different
neuromodulators, dopamine, norepinephrine serotonin function.
kind latent longer lasting impact systems impact mood wellbeing.
learning control stress really key. not depressed
somebody not lapsed depression recently, take control stress
system. entire episode conquer stress,

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want
imagine very, shallow hill, like mellow hill. just ramp set
10 15 degrees, okay. plotting mind
serious stress, trying finish degree relationship breakup,
family member sick, loss loved one pet, stress,
probability will experience major depression goes up. However,
carry gene, HTTLPR gene, steepness curve goes way, way


actually like line need far fewer bouts stress order lapse
major depression, okay? typical person doesn't carry
polymorphism experience two three four five bouts stress
lapse depression, somebody gene susceptible getting depression
just one two bouts intense stress, okay? genes
work. don't preordain determine depressed. raise
susceptibility. many genes, many things related heritability general, work
way. know strong genetic component depression. know?
Well, called concordant monozygotic twins. will identical twins.
can either one biological sack two biological sacks utero,
called monochorionic dichorionic. Well, typically monochorionic.
identical twins, one twins goes major depression,
50% probability one will major depression. not 100%, not
100% inherited, not 100% generic, might say, much higher
predisposition depression. Whereas fraternal twins, number drops,

want maintain good mood, want maintain positive affect pursuit
things life, things can do? turns things
can biology underlies utility things. Meaning


reasons things work will now make sense adjust things like
serotonin dopamine, adjust specific pathways. know
many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not
can follow recipe, also gives flexibility salt isn't
available, want adjust flavor dish, want try
new dish, want get experimental. understand mechanism, puts

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants

therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort

hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects

talk depression way clinicians talk depression, one
issues use word depression loosely. lot people say, "Oh,
depressed. "I didn't get job depressed. "I just don't know, really
rough week "or exhausted. "I'm depressed depressed "I thought
going go vacation "and canceled flight." Okay. not clinical
depression. called bummed out, sad disappointed. Now
person might depressed, clinical depression actually specific
criteria. criteria mainly characterized presence certain things
absence particular things. talk things present
somebody major depression. First all, tends lot grief.
tends lot sadness. no surprise. threshold cry often signature
depression. Now doesn't mean cry easily, depressed.
people cry easily others, somebody typically didn't cry easily
suddenly find crying easily, sign depression.
want emphasize, could. also thing call anhedonia, general
lack ability enjoy things, things typically previously enjoyed. Things like
food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, kind lack
enjoyment things. Sometimes lack enjoyment sad, sometimes
just flat, just kind neutral. doesn't feel good nothing there. like
bland food. like experiences analogous biting favorite article
food just not tasting good. just doesn't taste like anything all.

00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation

Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, particular anti-
self confabulation. anti-self confabulation? Well, first all, confabulation
incredible aspect mind nervous system. sometimes see forms


confabulation people memory deficits either brain
damage age-related dementia. good example someone
age related dementia sometimes will find location house
not know got there. ask them, "Oh, here?"
will create elaborate stories. "Oh, thinking going shopping
today, "and going take bus, "and going this." create
elaborate stories, confabulate. yet person hasn't left house
weeks person doesn't driver's license. really just creating
stuff. not lying get anything, confabulating. brain
circuit writes stories, just starts generating content. major depression,
often state delusional anti-self confabulation, confabulation not
directly completely linked reality, ones make self, person
describing them, seem sick way not well. good example
somebody experiences physical injury perhaps. Maybe break ankle,
maybe athlete, also happen become depressed. talk
say, "How things going? "How's rehab though?" go, "Oh,
okay. don't know. "I feel like getting weaker weaker day. "I'm just
not performing well." talk person working with,
kinesiologist whoever physical therapist is. say, "No, actually
really improving. "And tell improving, "but somehow not seeing
improvement, "they're not registering improvement." notice sometimes
subtle sometimes severe, start confabulating. say, "I actually
heard much better. "You're getting better, taking multiple trips
"around building now "before barely get bed." say, "Yeah,
well basically, changed things "about parking lot make easier
move around. "So not really me." aren't people just explaining
away accomplishments 'cause trying brush off praise. viewing
confabulating according view self-deprecating
point doesn't match reality. not people see
actually not matched reality. symptom depression think
don't often think conceptualize enough. not just telling people, "oh yeah,
not good seems. Everything's bad." people really believe

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,
be, just worn out. don't energy had. not
heads, probably, now think good data support fact
something off, something disrupted autonomic so-called vegetative
nervous system. one common symptoms people major
depression, one signs major depression early waking not able
fall back asleep despite exhausted. waking 3:00 4:00 5:00
just spontaneously not able go back sleep. want emphasize
happen reasons well, common symptom warning sign
major depression. talk sleep depression. well-known
architecture sleep disrupted depression. architecture sleep?
done entire episodes this, briefly two sentences, although
probably run sentences, early night, tend slow wave sleep
REM sleep Rapid Eye Movement sleep. night goes on, tend
Rapid Eye Movement sleep. architecture slow wave sleep preceding Rapid
Eye Movement sleep radically disrupted major depression. addition, pattern

sleep. can't people creating situation themselves.
real physiological signs something off so-called autonomic vegetative
nervous system. things relate autonomic


nervous system, normally think voluntary nature.
things like decreased appetite. can imagine one decreased
appetite anhedonia, lack pleasure food, right? don't
enjoy food, might less motivated eat it. makes sense. well
disruptions autonomic nervous system, vegetative
symptoms, called, can imagine someone decreased
appetite hormones associated appetite, hypocretin orexin
things sort, ghrelin, will disrupted. names hypocretin
orexin ghrelin don't make sense you, don't worry it. just
hormones impact eat, feel hungry, crave food
more, well feel full, enough so-called satiety. want learn
those, entire episodes eating metabolism. can see
symptomology major depression impacts us multiple levels.
conscious level excited generally. Well, reduced. grief,
guilt, crying, also vegetative things.
disruptions sleep, course make everything challenging

know this. appetite off. hormones get disrupted. cortisol
levels increased. particular, signature pattern depression whereby
cortisol, stress hormone normally released healthy way early

physiological signatures depressive like states. not one,
important one. lot things going major depression. now
probably thinking, goodness, dreadful. Like terrible stuff.
indeed terrible. terrible thing find oneself mode things feel sad,
feel guilty, exhausted. oftentimes also association

00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know

now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil

compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A

fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major

way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous

00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology

good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real

phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns

cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release

dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway

level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting

find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.

striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds

may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups

significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.

discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,

fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital

decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major

tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty

00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms Depression

example, particular instance used example, others
well. common symptomology major depression call vegetative
symptoms, okay? vegetative symptoms symptoms occur without
thinking, without doing, without confabulation. things
related core physiology. word vegetative, might know sounds like
vegetable. actually relates system body nowadays commonly
called autonomic nervous system. vegetative nervous system
autonomic nervous system, historically considered sort one same.
relates things like stress response ability sleep. vegetative
symptoms things like constantly exhausted. person just feels exhausted.
not exercise much, not necessarily life event,

00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity

drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called

looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column

striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown

kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety

meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups

significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.

discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous

00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing
safety feeling good oneself. understand understand
physical pain somehow involved certain cases, think will know
depression underlying chemistry people there. like

00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol

certainly go depth. really sets stage
headed next. next like talk hormones relate
depression. also like talk stress relates depression, well
talk genetics predispositions depression.
thinking, hey, want tools. want know fix depression.
understand desire that. will just ask hang little bit longer,
not will learn lot complicated mood disorder works,
interesting things it, will also position get lot
tools will describe. always option skip forward course,
think important understand hormonal stress-related aspects
depression. talk hormones. 20% people major depression

thyroid medication increase thyroid output people depressed will
work relieve symptoms. isn't necessarily direct problem serotonin,
dopamine, norepinephrine substance abuse. Sometimes thyroid problem.
certain situations conditions can impact thyroid hormone system
make people susceptible depression make pre-existing depression
worse. things like childbirth. well-known women give birth
can often undergo called postpartum depression. actually comes word
post parturition depression. give birth, happier, joyful
birth new healthy child, will lapse depression. thought
hormonally related, either directly thyroid system perhaps cortisol

certain phases menstrual cycle experience symptoms much like
clinical depression, oftentimes diagnosed clinical depression appropriately.
course menstrual cycle associated shifts hormone levels. well,
menopausal post-menopausal women susceptible major depression,
regardless whether not major depression earlier life.
things lookout definitely talk doctor get blood
panel hopefully includes measures thyroid hormone cortisol hormone.
cortisol hormone? Well stress correlated bouts major depression
across lifespan. many bouts? Well, turns go one
two three, well, hit four five bouts really intense, stressful episodes
life, tend long-term stressful episodes, risk major depression goes
way up. whether not genetic predisposition depression not, one
best things can try avoid getting depressed learn control
stress system, not go short-term stress, everybody experiences,
short-term stressors, medium term stress long-term stress, not

way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can

now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine

involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine

increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people

category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis

meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects

luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage

00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin

just take minutes talk underlying biology
creates cloud constellation symptomology. think really important
want understand various treatments, work
work implement them, understand underlying
biology. spend minutes talking biology depression,
known not known. that, think get much clearer
picture certain tools work relieve depression others might not.
one important early findings search biological basis depression
finding drugs relieve symptoms depression.
drugs generally fall three major categories, first set ones
discovered so-called tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. don't need understand nomenclature,
going give little bit detail want understand it, can.
work took place late 1950s 1960s, continued well
1980s new classes drugs discovered. tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors largely worked increasing levels norepinephrine
brain, well body, cases. discovered kind
odd set circumstances. don't time go history, suffice say
discovered exploration drugs alter blood pressure.
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure, drugs lower blood pressure reduce
levels norepinephrine. many cases, shown lead depression
depressive like symptoms. drugs, tricyclic drugs, MAO
inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine. frankly, quite good job
relieving some, not symptoms major depression. However, carry
many side effects. side effects side effects related blood
pressure itself, increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine called, raise
blood pressure. can dangerous, can uncomfortable. also
lot side effects. reason side effects impact
systems brain body impact things like libido, appetite, digestion,
others. talk sequence. Okay, experience
clinicians observing relief depression tricyclic antidepressants


MAO inhibitors terrific, side effects, side effects
people really not like, didn't like drugs all. lot people get dry
mouth, mentioned low libido, sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.
made people uncomfortable preferred not take them, even
though didn't take them, worsening maintenance
depressive symptoms. decade later, discovery so-called
pleasure pathways brain. pathways, literally groups neurons
reside different locations brain connect one another. circuit.
stimulate neurons certain behaviors electrical stimulation
experiment, believe not, done animals humans, animals
humans become very, motivated get stimulation pathways.
pleasure pathway circuits pleasure call reinforcing.
fact, animals humans will work hard get stimulation brain areas even
will work obtain sex, drugs, even addicted particular
drug state withdrawal, ultimate state craving, given choice,
person animal will select stimulation pleasure pathway instead
drug itself. major significant finding. pleasure pathway,
sometimes called, involves areas like nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental
area. areas brain rich neurons make dopamine.
think symptoms depression, anhedonia, lack pleasure, lack ability
experience pleasure, well, smoking gun something wrong
dopamine pathway depression. indeed case. not just
norepinephrine, also dopamine pleasure pathway

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able
trigger production neurons brain, particular areas
hippocampus called dentate gyrus others, impact memory.
important. going come back memory. SSRIs
shown various scientific studies reopen critical periods plasticity. just briefly
describe one studies. study done Lamberto Maffei's group
Pisa, explored brain plasticity known present young animals
disappear older animals. also true humans younger humans
far plastic brain can change many ways easily can
older brain. showed fluoxetine, Prozac, given adult animals
can reopen incredible period plasticity, can allow plasticity occur.
interesting. mean, purely increases serotonin transmission.
studies showing fluoxetine can increase number new neurons
born adult brain,

00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving,
Serotonin/Emotions

called neurogenesis, production new neurons. clear
least three major chemical systems brain; norepinephrine, dopamine,
serotonin relate can adjust symptoms depression. actually
can divided separate categories. instance, epinephrin norepinephrine
thought relate so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor
retardation. lethargy, exhaustion, inability get
bed morning. Dopamine thought relate anhedonia, say lack
dopamine depressive patients thought lead anhedonia. lack
ability experience pleasure. serotonin thought relate grief, guilt,
cognitive emotional aspects depression. got
norepinephrine system related activity alertness, dopamine system relating
motivation, pleasure, ability seek experience pleasure,
serotonin system related grief. unfortunately, brains organisms don't
work simple mathematical way just say, oh, well, person's
experiencing lot grief, don't problems lethargy.


just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine
make want drugs. start realize makes sense
paper doesn't always make sense clinically. complicated. really
good psychologist really good psychiatrist will work someone try pull
push various systems find combination drugs may may
not correct them.

00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain Linked: Substance P

fourth aspect chemistry depression really important
understand. pain. talked pain podcast before, even
didn't hear episode pleasure pain, just want emphasize pain
something experience body, no surprise there, injury, cut, et cetera,
also experience emotional pain. systems linked
intricate ways. actually data showing pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
sorts things, can help certain people emotional pain. Now not
recommending people run take things emotional pain. actually,
think it, shouldn't come surprise. given enormous number
people take painkillers, opioids things like try relieve
psychological pain. know, drugs very, problematic many
individuals. can help certain individuals, prone abuse
can induce addiction easily number people. substance
literally called substance P, letter P, manufactured neurons brain


body, underlies sensation pain. indeed substance P inhibitors
used treat depression, cases works. lot people depression
hypersensitive pain, course multiple things going on.
chronic pain chronic injury major depression. start get
constellation many things happen. want say today
chemistry underlying depression major depression. lot
there, think understand norepinephrine system relates
things like lethargy, psychomotor defects, called, dopamine
relates motivation lack motivation lack dopamine depression,
serotonin relationship grief, low serotonin can lead extreme
grief shame higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore sense wellbeing

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want

many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health

00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

somehow disrupted. 1980s, discovery so-called
SSRIs people now familiar SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors. SSRIs worked distinct mechanisms tricyclic antidepressants
MAO inhibitors. name suggests, SSRI, Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibitors prevent serotonin wiped synapse two neurons talk
one another. mean that? Well, basic Neurobiology 101.
don't know neurobiology, going know 15 seconds.
Neurons communicate one another spitting chemicals little gap


them. little gap called synapse Brits,
synapse. chemicals bind neuron opposite side cause changes
electrical activity neuron side synapse. Serotonin one
neurotransmitter specifically, neuromodulator, can change activity
large groups neurons meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means person takes drug, drugs include things like
Prozac Zoloft, typical names generic names things like
fluoxetine, people take those, serotonin hangs synapse able
taken neuron opposite side selective re-uptake
inhibition. prevents clearance serotonin synapse thereby
serotonin can effect. SSRIs don't increase total amount serotonin
brain. change effective serotonin already brain
changing activity neurons, okay? don't increase serotonin, increase
efficacy function serotonin way just described.
15 seconds, now understand SSRIs work. wouldn't talking
SSRIs didn't fact work. Yes, many problems SSRIs.
carry certain side effects many individuals. Also, third people take
SSRIs don't derive benefit, doesn't relieve symptoms depression.
However, two thirds, often relief some, not symptoms
major depression. problem side effects accompany SSRIs.
days SSRIs complicated topic. sort call barbed wire
topic often hear problems them, drugs also
saved lot lives. also improved lot lives. issue tend
varying effects different individuals, sometimes varying effects time.
work awhile won't work while. also lot
mysteries SSRIs, mysteries bother people. mysteries
referring to? Well, SSRIs increase amount serotonin specifically,
increase efficacy serotonin synapse, happens immediately,
soon people start taking SSRIs. people generally don't start experiencing
relief symptoms depression going experience all,
two weeks start taking drugs. something going
not clear. One idea SSRIs actually can improve symptoms
depression even remove symptoms depression so-called neuro-plasticity
changing way neural circuits function. many this,


main categories studies SSRIs relate neuroplasticity fall two camps.
One ways SSRIs might, want emphasize, might able

just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get

drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway

level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,

find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes

melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different

different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different

not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major

realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism

particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health

just boost serotonin. paper works, oftentimes doesn't work clinically.
another patient, might get somebody can't experience pleasure,
kind anxious. don't trouble sleeping, just much
anxious frustrated normally are, meet symptoms
depression. Well, might think, oh, well, just give person drugs
increase dopamine everything will better? indeed, cases true.
drugs like Wellbutrin, function specifically dopamine
system increase dopamine also increase norepinephrine. Many people get
great relief things like Wellbutrin. don't really impact serotonin system
much. therefore don't get lot serotonergic serotonin related side
effects. However, people feel far anxious drugs, people get
addicted drugs way, lot drugs increase dopamine

impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine

increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create

category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively

alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A

kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.

powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects

SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal

controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA

changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety

different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't

whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including

discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people

fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA
appears responsible efficacy omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty


acids supplementation depression, evidence meta analysis randomized

really EPA one wants hit certain threshold level one's goal get
relief depression keep depression bay keeping mood elevated,
take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely
meshed emotions perceptions. odd state, hear.
odd state clinicians now leveraging treatment depression.

category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear

university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people

time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing

save discussion then.

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't

drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted

plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA

take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called

SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal

controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women

lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns

way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really

deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage

drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better

offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,

particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact

may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

way, way up. something seen again, not just
scientific career, just throughout life. People sorts domains, young old,
seen people will go intense relationship, breakup, sometimes
staying together stressful, sometimes graduate school can

depressed. stress system associated release
cortisol. cortisol system can dramatically impact way different
neuromodulators, dopamine, norepinephrine serotonin function.

learning control stress really key. not depressed
somebody not lapsed depression recently, take control stress
system. entire episode conquer stress,

00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility Depression: Impact Stress

involves dealing stress short term, medium term, long-
term. lot different ways that. One important reasons
learning counter stress order offset depression genetic
predisposition certain people carry become depressed. studies
now many, many thousands individuals, mainly done New Zealand,
studies now done elsewhere, looking many tens thousands
individuals carry particular copies genes, call polymorphisms,
particular gene called 5HTTLPR, serotonin transporter. gene
controls regulates much serotonin available brain.
gene, polymorphism, doesn't necessarily mean will depressed,
greatly shifts susceptibility depression conditions stress. realize
people listening people watching YouTube.
going describe way doesn't require looking graphs. want
imagine very, shallow hill, like mellow hill. just ramp set
10 15 degrees, okay. plotting mind
serious stress, trying finish degree relationship breakup,
family member sick, loss loved one pet, stress,
probability will experience major depression goes up. However,
carry gene, HTTLPR gene, steepness curve goes way, way


actually like line need far fewer bouts stress order lapse
major depression, okay? typical person doesn't carry
polymorphism experience two three four five bouts stress
lapse depression, somebody gene susceptible getting depression
just one two bouts intense stress, okay? genes
work. don't preordain determine depressed. raise
susceptibility. many genes, many things related heritability general, work
way. know strong genetic component depression. know?
Well, called concordant monozygotic twins. will identical twins.
can either one biological sack two biological sacks utero,

100% inherited, not 100% generic, might say, much higher
predisposition depression. Whereas fraternal twins, number drops,

next like turn specific tools people depression
prone depression, well people don't depression simply
want maintain good mood, want maintain positive affect pursuit
things life, things can do? turns things
can biology underlies utility things. Meaning


reasons things work will now make sense adjust things like
serotonin dopamine, adjust specific pathways. know
many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not
can follow recipe, also gives flexibility salt isn't
available, want adjust flavor dish, want try

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA
appears responsible efficacy omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty


acids supplementation depression, evidence meta analysis randomized
control trials. really wonderful paper. author Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-
S. published 2009. will provide link study caption.
study really one least me, points EPA particular
effective, whether not DHA problematic not separate issue,
really EPA one wants hit certain threshold level one's goal get
relief depression keep depression bay keeping mood elevated,
take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.
see mechanism see effectiveness, mechanism

vitally important actually one main nodes action

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely
meshed emotions perceptions. odd state, hear.
odd state clinicians now leveraging treatment depression.
talk is, talk little bit NMDA receptor
ketamine PCP might work treatment depression even
work. want direct area still needs lot data.
however, excellent papers really terrific groups. One paper
published nature last year, 2020. First author Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort

hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory

may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning

thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA
appears responsible efficacy omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty

take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine

time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just

increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal

controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors

way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort

hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

reasons things work will now make sense adjust things like
serotonin dopamine, adjust specific pathways. know
many people learning mechanism kind grueling. realized podcast
isn't necessarily one can listen passively things. Although
hope still enjoy extract information.
mechanism? Mechanism key mechanism little bit like understanding
chemistry cooking. read recipe can follow recipe,
often hear people say, oh, can follow recipe. means every
ingredient recipe, good. likely can make dish. can make
meal. However, understand little bit chemistry salt added
third not first, heat adjusted particular time, well not
can follow recipe, also gives flexibility salt isn't
available, want adjust flavor dish, want try
new dish, want get experimental. understand mechanism, puts
tremendous place power work system. not just plug
chug, like take 12 milligrams this, either feel better don't. can really
start understand prescription drugs, supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,
things weave together either work

00:52:50 Tools Dealing Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)

not work get paths healthy mind body. think
tool work relieve depression. talked
drugs impact different chemical systems might work create
problems create. Problems mainly created fact
impact lots systems brain body. take drug increase serotonin,
serotonin also related, not just mood, things related libido
appetite. start disrupting multiple systems. said
behavioral tools, right? behavioral tool adjusts levels particular
chemical perhaps, provide relief symptoms major
depression. take example talked podcast, is,
get cold shower, take ice bath, will release norepinephrine
epinephrine brain body. no question that. don't think
anyone can really escape that. kind universal response cold water.


Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.

invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects

real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system

just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal

interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make

brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine

increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people

time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different

also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.

doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data
published Sonnenberg Lab Stanford recently journal Cell, Cell

Well, aspects depression related low levels norepinephrine, will
taking cold showers relieve depression? Perhaps might even relieve certain
aspects depression. cure? Well, going depend individual.
Will exercise help? Well, go run, going increase amount
norepinephrine body. enjoy run, likely increase levels
dopamine probably serotonin brain body well. Will cure
depression? Well, lot studies exploring exercise can impact
depression. indeed, regular exercise known protective behavior
depression, also can help relieve symptoms depression.
may ask yourself, need drugs all? prescription
drugs need supplementation things alleviate symptoms
depression? Ah, well, diabolical nature depression, people far
enough along thing, sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,
major depression, oftentimes can't get energy even get take
bath shower. no motivation it, no desire go run.
say, "Come on, go, feel better. "I know feel better, generates
chemicals "I heard whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast getting action "does things." just don't want it.
you, person not experiencing depression, perhaps just seem
like frustrating confusing thing world. important
highlight fact circuits accessible us, circuits
happiness, pursuit pleasure, exercise, getting cold shower,
thing, circuits present people, certain people
experiencing major depression really depths depression, can't
really access circuits way people not suffering
depression can. hope makes clear. not offering excuses them.
indeed, think behaviors help jolt symptomology
depression, just not accessible everybody. talk things
people can deal depression. again, anytime add behavior
tool supplement, subtract behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
absolutely talk physician,

00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.



especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake

therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse

covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous

especially somebody dealing major depression. want focus
stress system. not just going tell get sunlight eyes get
good night's sleep, although think everybody regular basis, ideally
every day, talked ad nauseum podcast. will help sleep,
will help alleviate stress. think tools deal stress real
time, et cetera. look depression standpoint deeper biological
phenomenon, inflammation immune system. growing evidence
now many forms major depression, not them, relate excessive
inflammation. Now inflammation plays important role wound healing. positive
aspect immune system. ability combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation lasts long, high
amplitude, meaning many anti-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines things
sort body bad. decent evidence now inflammation can lead
exacerbate depression. want control depression, limit
eliminate depression, focusing reducing inflammation associated
pathways really good thing do. think really good thing everybody
regardless whether not suffer depression not. today
going talk exactly depression comes inflammation
pathway. So, first all, major players creating chronic inflammation
brain body? inflammatory cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
things like Tumor Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not
cytokines. interferons prostoglandins lot
things. stressed, chronically stressed, get inflamed, brain
various locations brain become inflamed certain classes cells,
particular, glial cells, cells typically thought just support cells,
cells biochemistry dialogue neurons brain
body starts become disrupted. may mentioned earlier, don't recall.
certainly mentioned earlier podcast adrenaline epinephrin, released
body, doesn't cross blood brain barrier, certain things
able cross blood-brain barrier stressed. Things like E2
prostoglandins, cross blood brain barrier. blood brain,
therefore brain body can communicate certain things can pass
barrier call BBB Blood Brain Barrier. also
something called glymphatic system, really plumbing system



00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA
appears responsible efficacy omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty


acids supplementation depression, evidence meta analysis randomized
control trials. really wonderful paper. author Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-
S. published 2009. will provide link study caption.
study really one least me, points EPA particular
effective, whether not DHA problematic not separate issue,
really EPA one wants hit certain threshold level one's goal get
relief depression keep depression bay keeping mood elevated,
take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.
see mechanism see effectiveness, mechanism
effectiveness map lot mechanisms involved prescription
drugs, gives great reassurance isn't just sort mysterious
pathway mysterious compound creatine might working. now


kind clustered together EPAs, exercise, relationship inflammation,
creatine relationship forebrain function, phosphocreatine system,
NMDA receptor. see minutes, NMDA receptor turns
vitally important actually one main nodes action

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely
meshed emotions perceptions. odd state, hear.
odd state clinicians now leveraging treatment depression.
talk is, talk little bit NMDA receptor
ketamine PCP might work treatment depression even
work. want direct area still needs lot data.
however, excellent papers really terrific groups. One paper
published nature last year, 2020. First author Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-
N-A, last author lead study, Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
guest Huberman Lab podcast months ago. world expert
neuroscience, psychiatrist. paper Sam Vesuna Karl
colleagues explored dissociative states come about. looked
animals humans found a, essentially common
mechanism whereby particular layer cortex, brain outer shell
tissue called neocortex. perceptions lie,

PCP. activation particular area brain, retro splenium cortex
called. dissociative state emerged interesting one.
clinically described trials ketamine things like it, people
depressed will take ketamine, will experience kind separateness grief
emotions. possibly plasticity, actually shifts neural
circuitry, emotions don't weigh heavily, using loose
language here, don't feel written burdened
emotions previously ketamine therapy. Now, absolutely no way,
shape form suggesting people run take ketamine order treat
depression. drugs still much experimental, although
approved certain contexts, least U S, prescription treatment
depression. interesting dissociative states sound least
outset separateness everything. sounds little bit like
depression itself. sort like anhedonia inability experience pleasure.
one takes dissociative anesthetic somehow able get relief getting
even away experience. me, doesn't make sense, just
speaks fact drugs receptors pathways operate
cryptic means. really don't understand pathways brain

guiding experience able get relief symptoms without need
many, many treatments drug. Just many treatments varies individual
individual, not like people take stuff ongoing. really
attempt tap NMDA receptor related neuroplasticity. ketamine
PCP essentially act antagonists, means block NMDA receptor.
different methods, non-competitive competitive chemists
pharmacologists there. can look like. therefore even
surprising every neuroscientist learns activation NMDA receptor,
not antagonism blocking NMDA receptor leads changes neural circuitry
profound ways. fact experimentally, done experiments myself,
want prevent plasticity, want prevent experience reshaping neural
circuitry, give MDA receptor blocker. done many times course
experimental neuroscience career, not myself, obviously, course


experiments. still bit mysterious work. couple
things. One layer five activation pretty interesting. going come back
layer five talk yet another emerging treatment depression,
psilocybin, so-called magic mushrooms, effects psilocybin layer five

sounding little bit vague you, still truly experimental
new, still much cutting edge happening now. don't

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing
psychedelics impact depressive states major depression
episode Matt. time being, really seems if, again, looking
neuroplasticity, coming back layer five, just like ketamine PCP.
hearing layer five, hearing rewiring circuitry, hearing
dissociation distancing oneself negative moods affects
narratives, key distinction ketamine work psilocybin
work, ketamine work, really dissociating experience
session psychiatrist, whereas psilocybin journey, really
immersing oneself experience fully present experience.
seem important component difference
seem provide relief major depression isn't clear. think
likely takes us back fact thing call major depression clearly involves
serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. individuals, may
deficient one several those, whereas individuals, might
different collection chemicals. course tremendous number
psychedelic compounds people exploring treatment major
depression. really psilocybin one data on. MDMA
mainly explored clinical realm treatment trauma. trials
ongoing treatment depression, big breakthrough seemed happening
realm trauma treatment, so-called maps group this, again,
legally clinical setting. groups starting well.
going entire podcast MDMA related compounds.
save discussion then.

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset

00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*

links brain body. link immune system brain.
Well, set actions can take order limit inflammation.
shown several quality peer reviewed studies now reduce inflammation
relieve some, cases, symptoms major depression. One
approaches increase intake so-called EPAs Essential Fatty Acids.
now long list papers quality peer review journals showing people
ingest certain level EPA omega-3 fatty acids, relief depressive symptoms
matches SSRIs. incredible, right? essential fatty acids relieve
symptoms depression, well prescription antidepressants. Now,
doesn't necessarily mean run off stop taking antidepressants
prescribed them, please don't that. Please talk physician.
mention studies shown increasing intake
essential fatty acids, particular, EPA variety omega-3s, can lower effective
dose things like SSRIs. Meaning required 50 milligram 40 milligram dose
fluoxetine, one can get lower dose thereby perhaps not experience
many severe side effects taking supplementing EPAs. Now,
threshold level seems one gram, 1000 milligrams EPA. will
sometimes see bottle krill oil fish oil source, even plant source
source EPA 1000 milligrams 1200 milligrams. really
important look whether not 1000 milligrams EPA,
EPA particular important here. actually exploring
literature effects EPAs cardiovascular health, excuse me, well
effects depression, interesting dose dependent responses,
people took anywhere 400 milligrams 5,000 milligrams EPAs, achieved
variety different benefits. cases, side effects, talk those.
seem 1000 milligrams critical threshold benefiting
getting relief depressive symptoms. people took two grams seem
better. cardiovascular health realm, little complicated.
studies point positive effect cardiovascular health taking increasing
amounts EPA, others, not much. current data point fact every
gram EPA one ingest, 9% improvement cardiovascular health,


dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,

aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause

people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting

sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called

depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women

lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine

increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people

ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis

Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people

hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience

doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data
published Sonnenberg Lab Stanford recently journal Cell, Cell
Press Journal, excellent journal ingestion fermented foods really keeps
gut microbiome tuned up, speak, well order offset inflammatory
cytokines, keeping inflammation bay, just turns really good thing order
keep mood good place. EPA, exercise, fermented foods, creatine
potential source relief depression offsetting, keeping us away major
depression relapse depression. talked prescription
compounds compounds used mainly course studies
psychiatry depression, things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin, related
compounds. lastly, talked ketosis, may not right

dose dependent improvement psychological health combating
depression can't really stated. wouldn't say EPA take, better
going feel speak. don't think data point that. However,
seem take gram, 1000 milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA,
seem substantial relief many people, emphasize many, not all,

01:02:50 EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine,
Quinolinic Acid

many people major depressive symptoms. work? Well, turns
inflammatory cytokines, impact neurons circuits brain
relate things like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. inflammatory
cytokines act variety different ways, mainly act inhibit release
serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, synthesis serotonin, norepinephrine
dopamine. give one example EPAs can positively impact
process. points second tool, proper utilization exercise
offset effects depression. now understand healthy
levels serotonin important maintaining healthy mood. not responsible
aspects healthy mood, also dopamine norepinephrine,
important one. Dopamine also called 5HT, essentially derives precursor
called tryptophan. Tryptophan arrives system diet, okay, tryptophan
amino acid. Tryptophan found Turkey, found carbohydrates.
therefore raise idea, hmm, wonder one reasons people
depressed appetite carbohydrate late foods trying
get tryptophan, therefore serotonin. indeed case.
Tryptophan eventually converted serotonin. However, excessive
amounts inflammation, inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan not
converted much serotonin, diverted different pathway.
pathway involves something called IDO, Indoleamine, converts tryptophan
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts neurotoxin way converting
something called quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid pro depressive. seems
like complicated biochemical pathway, basically happening
tryptophan normally made serotonin, conditions inflammation
diverted neurotoxic pathway. ingestion EPAs, limits


inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause
tryptophan one ingests

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,
tends sequester shuttle contouring muscle isn't converted
neurotoxin pro depression, okay? lot steps pathway
leading depression, essentially means hitting certain threshold
level EPA intake, whether supplementation fish oil krill oil
plant source not ingesting fish krill, trying get 1000
milligram threshold EPA ingesting particular food sources, certainly can
food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA
appears responsible efficacy omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty


acids supplementation depression, evidence meta analysis randomized
control trials. really wonderful paper. author Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-
S. published 2009. will provide link study caption.
study really one least me, points EPA particular
effective, whether not DHA problematic not separate issue,
really EPA one wants hit certain threshold level one's goal get
relief depression keep depression bay keeping mood elevated,
take high-dose EPA. got EPA, got exercise,

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.
see mechanism see effectiveness, mechanism
effectiveness map lot mechanisms involved prescription
drugs, gives great reassurance isn't just sort mysterious
pathway mysterious compound creatine might working. now


kind clustered together EPAs, exercise, relationship inflammation,
creatine relationship forebrain function, phosphocreatine system,
NMDA receptor. see minutes, NMDA receptor turns
vitally important actually one main nodes action

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely
meshed emotions perceptions. odd state, hear.
odd state clinicians now leveraging treatment depression.
talk is, talk little bit NMDA receptor
ketamine PCP might work treatment depression even
work. want direct area still needs lot data.
however, excellent papers really terrific groups. One paper
published nature last year, 2020. First author Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-
N-A, last author lead study, Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
guest Huberman Lab podcast months ago. world expert

clinically described trials ketamine things like it, people
depressed will take ketamine, will experience kind separateness grief

emotions previously ketamine therapy. Now, absolutely no way,
shape form suggesting people run take ketamine order treat
depression. drugs still much experimental, although
approved certain contexts, least U S, prescription treatment
depression. interesting dissociative states sound least

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

01:05:25 Protocol 4: Exercise Offsets Depression

body diverted towards serotoninergic pathway. Exercise, turns
out, also positive effect tryptophan serotonin conversion pathway.
way really interesting. now know tryptophan can either
converted serotonin can converted neurotoxin, bad thing.
Exercise, activation muscles rhythmic repeated use, particular
aerobic exercise, also resistance training shown extent,

food, don't supplement, easier supplements,
will limit inflammation diverts tryptophan neurotoxic pathway.
exercise well, augments conversion tryptophan serotonin
takes thing potentially neurotoxin sequesters it, pulls away
can't actually go pro depressive effects. got multiple steps
here. describing two tools, increasing EPA regular exercise way
increasing serotonin, somewhat indirectly, right? limiting bad pathway
promote activity good pathway. data published Quality
Peer Review journals, really appears inflammation pathway function
increase depression pathways. knowing behavioral
steps supplementation based steps, prefer getting EPAs typical
food, nutritional approaches, find reassuring mechanisms
converge common pathway, serotonin. gives great peace mind
people say, hey, go run, get outdoors exercise,
take fish oil like Scandinavians do, Scandinavian family members
known to, say quite open fact
winter months particular depression likely, throughout year,


really, make effort regularly ingest high levels EPA, either ingesting
fatty fish skin, not particular fan ingesting skin fatty fish,
supplementing Cod liver oil types fish oil, sardines, things
sort, sardine oils. number different things one use.
find reassuring common biochemical pathway can explain
things not just work, work. work
operate biochemical pathways antidepressants prescribed
people do. mean you? Well, somebody suffers
major depression, again, don't stop taking prescribed medication. Talk
doctor, talk perhaps EPAs exercise things can
impinge biochemical pathways. somebody not suffering
major depression, still think pathways really important understand.
actually knowing pathways additional motivation get regular exercise.
think know getting anywhere 150 minutes 180 minutes
per week so-called zone two cardio cardiovascular effects. Zone two kind
melowish cardio can sort hold conversation needed to.
little bit tough, kind sucking air little bit. going limit
depressive like symptoms, think us. don't think think
depression strict threshold. somebody personally made choice
take 1000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementing fish oil. debate
whether not better take EPA NDHA particular ratios,
whether not DHA can impact LDL, so-called bad cholesterol.
getting really weeds. can talk future episode.
myself, notice pretty substantial positive effect taking anywhere 1000
milligrams 2000 milligrams EPA per day. supplementation
strive try eat fish, even though frankly, never liked taste fish.
like little detail perhaps lot detail
effects EPA depression relieving depressive symptoms, want
get nitty gritty it, invite go examine.com, put depression, EPA,
list off links 28 studies effects EPA major depression.
go pub med, many, many studies now date back several
decades, really. interested specific effects EPA, opposed DHA,
want point towards particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, not DHA

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything

involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create

ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different

screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.

discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience

doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*

now understand work adjust mood. Now, want talk something
least me, quite surprising first learned sake
treatment mood disorders, creatine. Creatine number
important functions throughout body. resistance
training, actually endurance training well, creatine
achieved lot popularity recent years supplementation creatine
can draw water muscles can increase power output muscles.
something indeed work. debates whether not
unhealthy kidneys take long-term creatine, supplementation high doses.
invite go rabbit hole. think people now accept idea
people, not all, people, low dose creatine supplementation
anywhere one gram five grams per day can number positive effects
physical performance. People kidney issues, et cetera, need especially
cautious, creatine interesting purpose. However, also so-called
phosphocreatine system brain, phosphocreatine system everything
dialogue neurons cell types called, glial, glial
comprise several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, foster creatine
system forebrain particular, front brain, shown
involved regulation mood reward pathways well
depression. now several studies, least three, although probably
time comes coming quickly now, least
three quality studies pointing fact creatine supplementation doesn't just
positive effects physical performance, can also used way


increase mood improve symptoms major depression. now
done several double blind placebo controlled studies. studies looked
women, looked men, looked adolescents, taking
SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system
forebrain can beneficial least correlated improvements mood.
just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal
Psychiatry 2012, published study, randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial oral creatine monohydrate. found augment
enhance response selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, particular, women
major depressive disorder. like EPA, creatine supplementation seems either
lower required dose SSRI required treat depression, can improve
effectiveness given dose SSRI. However, studies
looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors
brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. NMDA
receptor one first things every budding neuroscientists learns
receptor particular electrical chemical properties make
critical gate so-called neuroplasticity. not receptor activated
brain, typically just functioning brain day-to-day basis. receptor
activated circuits going change, inspired change


strong stimulus, meaning experience, cases drug,
cases something else. NMDA receptor kind key node shifting
brain circuitry. details aren't entirely clear, seems creatine
supplementation leads increases phosphocreatine system forebrain.
increases activity forebrain phosphocreatine system relate changes
way NMDA receptors function may lead plasticity,
changes neural circuits underlie shift negative mood affect
positive mood. Now, lot gaps. lot little boxes bins
diagram just laid you. still truly black boxes, say,
meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve
mood. choice made within margins safety
life. don't know right everybody, find interesting.
again, find particularly interesting logical biochemical pathway
support finding improves mood can offset effects major depression
cases, can improve effects antidepressant medication many cases.

01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function

novel exciting therapeutics explored now
psychiatric clinics. talk little bit NMDA receptor
relates experimental novel therapeutic compounds
treatment major depression. compounds going talking about,
may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people
abused drugs, go street name, special K, et cetera. create
dissociative anesthetic states. dissociative states people don't feel closely
meshed emotions perceptions. odd state, hear.
odd state clinicians now leveraging treatment depression.
talk is, talk little bit NMDA receptor
ketamine PCP might work treatment depression even

however, excellent papers really terrific groups. One paper

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety

major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people

time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70

important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive

neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects

SSRIs, not, done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
spectroscopy way can look concentrations particular brain
real time humans, can used things well, course. basically
observed increasing activity phosphocreatine system

just talk moment involved using supplementing creatine
order improve mood perhaps even treat depression. First all, talk
creatine, talking creatine monohydrate, number different forms
creatine. talking creatine monohydrate. American Journal

looked directly creating supplementation absence SSRIs.
interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects
dosages, et cetera. not going read off every line every column
review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show

meaning, don't really know yet. mechanistic data
coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking
bipolar depression today, seems creatine elevates levels activation
kind mood overall. see problem somebody
already manic phase, actually might beneficial somebody
low affect major depression. supplement creatine?
Well, always, talk healthcare provider, somebody thinking
things can things can take order improve mood,
keep depression bay, maybe even support treatments major depression.
creatine system seems like logical one. least strong studies good
number look to, determine whether not right you. personally
take five grams creatine reasons. take physical performance,
enhancing effects, kind nice think perhaps also helping improve

may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis

read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people

time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience

discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different

doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past

fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities

interesting well. wonderful comprehensive review creatine
treatment major depression includes beautiful tables subjects

review, will provide link review well. One things really
striking lists studies include used dosages
pretty reasonable people, anywhere three grams five grams,
sometimes many 10 grams per day creatine. Many also shown
increase activity phosphocreatine system forebrain, show
relationship phosphocreatine system particular category receptors

coming. However, look data review, look
data review, find pretty striking positive effects creatine.
one interesting effects creatine actually shown
increase mania people already manic. interesting, not talking

may heard before, one ketamine, getting increasing interest
psychiatric clinics various experimental clinical studies, PCP.
ketamine PCP known drugs abuse. many years, people

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing
psychedelics impact depressive states major depression
episode Matt. time being, really seems if, again, looking
neuroplasticity, coming back layer five, just like ketamine PCP.
hearing layer five, hearing rewiring circuitry, hearing
dissociation distancing oneself negative moods affects

work, ketamine work, really dissociating experience

immersing oneself experience fully present experience.
seem important component difference
seem provide relief major depression isn't clear. think
likely takes us back fact thing call major depression clearly involves
serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. individuals, may
deficient one several those, whereas individuals, might

save discussion then.

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous

words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high

neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric

transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol

now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

reminiscent saw EPA supplementation. today
covered least feels me, like tremendous amount material. topic
depression indeed enormous topic try get arms around. talked
symptomology, talked underlying neurochemistry biology,
talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find
place depression. mentioned way back beginning
episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really
deficient many forms major depression. depression, now
deliberate pursuit epinephrin inducing activities healthy, aren't
adrenaline seeking per se, things like cold showers, things like particular patterns
breathing engage tend make us alert, things like exercise will
increase levels noradrenaline. remiss said activities
completely eliminate depressive symptoms people major depressive disorder.
don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health
background. margins safety, people probably quite large,
people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous
podcast, terms keeping Inflammatone, molecules create
inflammation, inflammation can limit amount serotonin
pathways described. order that, also very, useful ingest two four
servings fermented foods daily basis near daily basis. data

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.
work? Well, remember ketogenic diet wasn't discovered
self appointed nutrition gurus talk online people
make money selling anything related ketosis. not disparaging
ketogenic diet. helped lot people. ketogenic diet actually shown
medically relevant use treat epilepsy. turns epilepsy, particular
pediatric epilepsy, ketogenic diet shift brain metabolism


predominantly one ketones metabolized rather standard
glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce number epileptic seizures
children experience. not always case, often case. talk
neurologist neurosurgeon specialized epilepsy, particular pediatric
epilepsy, tell this, "Oh yeah, ketogenic diet, many cases, not all,
"can effective treatment." How? ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, way reduces seizures increasing called GABA
transmission. GABA substance naturally released brain.
inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning released synapse,
tendency reduce firing, reduce electrical activity next neuron sets
neurons. various compounds increase GABA, particular, GABA
forebrain. One common example something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic
drink two will increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower social inhibitions
increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
GABA system rich array effects brain body. alcohol tends
activate release GABA. might say, well not just take alcohol
suppress seizures? Well, terrible idea tends rebound
excitability alcohol stops effects GABA receptors.
excitability epilepsy terrible. reason
epileptic diet useful epilepsy increases call tonic level, sort
ti, level GABA brain, suppresses
hyperexcitability, characteristic feature epilepsy. drugs,
instance, benzodiazepines things Xanax, variety, Valium, forth.
increased GABA transmission. drugs also lot potential abuse
addiction, et cetera, problematic reasons. ketogenic
diet, way increasing ketone metabolism shifting brain's metabolism
ketones tends modulate GABA GABA active adjust so-
called GABA glutamate balance. getting technical, glutamate excitatory
neurotransmitter, GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter, balance vital
neuroplasticity, maintaining healthy levels activity brain, et cetera.
decent evidence people major depressive disorders, particular,
people major depressive disorders refractory, meaning don't respond


classical antidepressants, can benefit, seems, ketogenic diet. Now
not always case, struggling major
depression, drugs not worked, please talk psychiatrist. don't
know many literature ketogenic diet EPAs
rest. Psychiatrists vary terms involved current literature
tend be, many excellent psychiatrists there.
experience, actually quite avid learners happening new
realm call psychiatry. really interesting eating particular
way, lowering carbohydrates point rely ketogenic metabolism
brain, increases GABA can provide relief depressive symptoms.
particular, seems positive effects people refractory don't
respond classic antidepressants. include things like fluoxetine, et
cetera. make one final point ketogenic diets GABA depression,
also shown people respond well drugs impact
serotonin system, dopamine system, norepinephrine, ketogenic diet,
may improve ability drugs work lower dosages,

01:54:50 Summary Protocols Covered

talked approaches deal really grounded
neurochemistry biology. just want recap tools things
are. First all, talked making effort not overwhelm pleasure system.
might seem counterintuitive. not overly seek pleasure, else one can find

episode, young man know really struggling depression,
thought, don't know sure, thought depression
probably triggered overindulgence video games highly dopaminergic
activities point activities eventually countered pain
balance Dr. Anna Lembke described. now activities
repeatedly many, many hours day, just feel okay, not even derive


pleasure them. worse, many activities, practically activities
lost zest, lost excitement sense pleasure them.
really active campaign now reset system. So, number one, don't
overwhelm pleasure centers either activities compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, setting anhedonia depression
that. not just addiction too, also setting
anhedonia depression. often can engage activities? Well,
going differ person person, everyone's slightly different, really
mind extreme highs extreme lows cautious those.
probably Dr. Lembke future time try get specifics
that. feel like need reset system, really seem like
30 day complete detox whatever activity substance is. ideally doesn't
continue 30 days, especially conditions drugs abuse. Second all,
talks norepinephrine system norepinephrine system really

don't think case. again, want acknowledge people major
depressive symptoms often don't energy, willingness, capacity
engage activities, things like cold shower, deliberate cold showers,
things like regular exercise, aren't just feel good activities. actually engage
norepinephrine system keep system tuned allow us increase
norepinephrine levels will regular basis. mood enhancing effects
real effects level neurochemistry, talked EPAs, Essential Fatty
Acids, clear people, getting 1000 milligrams probably
even closer 2000 milligrams per day EPAs can beneficial mood, especially
attempts treat offset major depressive disorder. side effects? Well,
need explore doctor, everyone different health

people might not case. definitely check physician.
also talked exercise EPA exercise regular basis can offset


inflammatory pathways. want mention something mentioned previous

01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) Major Depression: Psilocybin*

people veering towards self-harm, mutilation, suicide. may
noticed theme, certain categories approaches
discussing offsetting symptoms depression, exercise, ingesting EPAs,
reducing inflammation, even SSRIs increasing serotonin, focus changing
core biological function, like raising amount chemical, serotonin,
reducing amount inflammatory cytokines brain body. yet things like
ketamine focus rewiring circuitry, changing neural circuitry functions
better immediate hopefully long-term well, keep people
major depression call, remission, away major depression. Another
category treatments actively explored now laboratories
psychiatry realm psychedelics. huge category compounds.
However, one particular, psilocybin one intensely actively
pursued capacity treat major depressive disorder. want clear
work going describe work done university settings,
university hospitals, scientists psychiatrists, clinical studies, clinical
trials, leading peer reviewed data. data discussing.
major luminaries area include, course aren't limited to, include
people like Matthew Johnson Johns Hopkins. discuss work
now, fortunate say will coming podcast guest just scribe
studies variety laboratories, working variety different psychedelic
compounds, focus psilocybin capacity rewire neural circuits
alleviate depression. anecdotal data evidence years
psilocybin capacity, psilocybin work? Well, psilocybin, magic


mushrooms, sometimes called, mainly works called serotonin 5H2A
receptor affinity 5HT1 receptor. mean? Well, basically,
got lot different kinds serotonin receptors just lot different
kinds dopamine receptors types receptors. advantage
different receptors expressed different parts brain body, even different
parts individual cells brain body compound, serotonin, can
diverse set effects different cells tissues. also basis
side effect profiles SSRIs, maybe instance, know taking
Prozac fluoxetine will increase serotonin one area, also another area.
will go diverse effects different brain circuits variety
receptors. Receptors just like parking slots molecule serotonin parks
different effects. Well psilocybin engages increases serotonin transmission,
meaning increases amount serotonin, mainly acting 5H2A receptors,
brain happen major effects? First, talk
major effects 'cause think people interested in. study
like highlight fairly recent one. published may 2021 Journal
American Medical Association Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, entitled, "Effects
Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive Disorder, Randomized Clinical
Trial." absolutely beautiful study, important study. includes
luminaries area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, others.
will provide link study. available full form zero cost want
read it. got lot detail. just going summarize things, basically
screened patients come clinic. people
suffered major depressive disorder, administered either one two rounds
psilocybin. used particular dosages listed study. can look
really interested level detail. Typically 20 milligrams per
kilogram body weight. depends body weight. 30 milligrams psilocybin
per 70 kilograms body weight. given capsule form. people weren't
eating mushrooms. obviously controlled study wanted
control dosages appropriately. randomized begin treatment
immediately eight week delay. appropriate control groups
one like see. really striking study
significant improvement mood affect relief depressive symptoms
anywhere 50 70% people subjects study received


psilocybin treatment. whether not 50 whether not 71%, varied
according long study maintain antidepressive effects,
whether not stayed remission depression, really
enormous insignificant effects, exciting pointing direction
psilocybin soon, becoming treatment various forms depression, including
major depression. Now, course, limited laboratory present.
number elements studies important take consideration too,
highly trained guides, meaning people direct people
experience. Matthew Johnson told me, occurrence time
time people so-called bad trips anxiety attacks
hallucinations that. ways mitigate deal
guides trained. sorts medical monitoring devices
heart rate temperature things one like see study like this,
powerful compounds. don't want give away elements
discussion Matthew Johnson, will released podcast form
reasonably soon here, Huberman Lab podcast. one things came
fundamental question had, think probably many asking,
experience one compounds make difference whether
not somebody gains relief depression, psilocybin journeys not?
words, matter talk about? matter think about?
matter good trip bad trip? don't want hold
much suspense, let Matthew provide thorough answer. really
interesting common themes psilocybin administration
experience lead relief depressive symptoms, subjectively
varied, meaning whether not people feel good experience bad
experience, whether not people thought parents thought color
ceiling, doesn't seem much impact whether not
receive relief studies clinical studies. seems like different people
can lots different experiences still receive benefit. points
something deeper. points fact drugs, really are,
rewiring neural circuitry common way despite diversity experience
drug. really interesting. takes us back place
discussion, layer five cortex. area ketamine seems
impact well generating rhythms the, mentioned one three Hertz activity


layer five certain areas cortex. Well, 5HT1A receptor known
enriched layer five cortex, layer five cortex interesting area
area lot lateral connectivity. connections
different brain areas laterally, generally allows us merge different
senses. instance, hear sound off right here, turn
right. hardwired response. typically hear something off
right, don't look left. hardwired circuits are.
appears happening activation serotonin system 5HT1A
receptor layer five offering providing experience whereby lateral
connections able engage much broadly normally. Now
also bad thing. asked Matt this, sounds kind spooky.
don't know hear something off right, want look off left.
highly maladaptive, especially car coming right.
doesn't seem happening. not really rewiring deeply reflexive
circuits. somehow rewiring associations events, emotional events, past
events, current events, future events ways allow people get sort
relief distance narratives, depressive stories past
present allow see new opportunity optimism future. really
fascinating thing really think it, thought simply
ramping laterality connections, meaning cross associations, things
either rewired randomly ways don't serve us, perhaps just cause no
effect all. either going bad neutral, not really way things
turning out. Again, highly controlled studies. want emphasize
ketamine, psilocybin, things still illegal. places.
regions cities United States locally decriminalized,
not legal. still illegal. referring indeed clinical studies
people taking legally. think likely will see shift
legislature around psychedelics, particular, psilocybin not distant future.
think now, know Matt told hear
far about, psilocybin. one cases, two dose
treatments done highly clinical setting, controlled setting patients
carefully selected, can many cases, majority people receive maintain relief
depressive symptoms, simply experience psychedelic
journey. ask micro dosing. made sound never heard


before. Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, answer interesting.
answer microdosing effects don't seem nearly impactful
these, well, just call are. kind high amplitude sessions
just one two, studies ongoing two,
microdosing doesn't seem compare macrodosing, mentioned
dosages before, 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms 30 milligrams per 70
kilograms dosages given several weeks apart. hear microdosing
psychedelics impact depressive states major depression
episode Matt. time being, really seems if, again, looking
neuroplasticity, coming back layer five, just like ketamine PCP.
hearing layer five, hearing rewiring circuitry, hearing
dissociation distancing oneself negative moods affects
narratives, key distinction ketamine work psilocybin
work, ketamine work, really dissociating experience
session psychiatrist, whereas psilocybin journey, really
immersing oneself experience fully present experience.
seem important component difference
seem provide relief major depression isn't clear. think
likely takes us back fact thing call major depression clearly involves
serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine. individuals, may
deficient one several those, whereas individuals, might

actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.

increasing neurochemical inhibition. basically suppresses self-monitoring
pathways. people drink enough, will suppress pathways people will
urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.

01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

One common questions get podcast different diets,


different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, vegan
diets, intermittent fasting, meat diet, so-called lion diet, et cetera.
actually really interesting data relating nutrition diet major depressive
disorder. think just need frame returning something said
earlier, ingestion carbohydrates, particular carbohydrates
meats like turkey, rich tryptophan, precursor serotonin,
many ways self-medicating version depression treatment. Now, clear, not
saying people use food medicate depression. Many people
reflexively however, reach carbohydrate rich foods blunt cortisol,
indeed does. blunts cortisol ingest high carbohydrate
foods, particular starchy foods, increase serotonin, particular,
foods rather rich amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food wonderful
important great, ingesting excessive foods kinds, carbohydrate
otherwise not healthy, course. explorations whether
not vegan diet can improve symptoms depression. Not lot data, not impressive
data. controlled studies looking carnivore meat
diet. that, think now starting spin up, meaning
studies starting spin up. However, ketogenic diet explored
ability relieve certain symptoms depression, particular called maintain
euthymia. Euthymia kind state equilibrium manic episode
depressive episode manic bipolar person. return future
episode, basically, maniacs highs lows, bipolars, either cycle
back forth really quickly. rapid cycling bipolars slow, people really
quickly can day day, people month month week week,
going highs lows. hear mania hear dysphoria,
euthymia kind place middle people feel neither high
low. interesting studies looking ketogenic diet maintaining
euthymia manic depressives, also people major depressive disorder.

urinate fall over. will eventually inhibit sorts pathways.
