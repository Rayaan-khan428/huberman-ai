intense need share people, presumably process make sense
it. Now numerous people throughout history tried make sense dreams
sort organized way. famous course Sigmund Freud
talked symbolic representations dreams. lot kind

08:10 Chemical Cocktails Sleep

surprising similarity lot dream states yet really important
differences. Okay. start talking slow wave sleep, non REM sleep.
realized slow wave sleep non REM sleep aren't exactly thing.
sleep aficionados there, lumping right now. say science,
lumpers splitters both. Sometimes lump, sometimes
split. sake clarity ease conversation right now gonna lumper.
say slow wave sleep, mean non REM sleep generally. Although, acknowledge
distinction. Slow wave sleep. slow wave sleep characterized
particular pattern brain activity brain metabolically active,
big sweeping waves activity include lot brain. wanna
look can find evidence sweeping waves neural activity across
association cortex, across big swaths brainstem, so-called pons geniculate
occipital pathway. brainstem, thalamus, cortex
interested. Although, going occur REM sleep. Now interesting
thing slow wave sleep neuromodulators tend associated it,
active least active slow wave sleep why. remind
neuromodulators chemicals act rather slowly main role
bias particular brain circuits active brain circuits not active.
like music playlist. think neuromodulators come names of,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, think suggesting
playlists audio device. So, know, classical music distinctly different feel
tone number features like third wave punk, from, know,
hip hop, right? think biasing toward particular genres neural circuit
activity, okay. Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music, rhythmic music


includes lyrics versus rhythmic music doesn't include lyrics. less way
think neuromodulators. associated consequence
certain brain functions. know instance just review, acetylcholine
waking states neuromodulator tends amplify activity brain circuits
associated focus attention. Norepinephrine neuromodulator tends
amplify brain circuits associated alertness, desire move. Serotonin
neuromodulator released intense amplify circuits brain body
associated bliss desire remain still. dopamine
neuromodulator released associated amplification neural circuits
brain body associated pursuing goals pleasure reward. Okay.
slow wave sleep something really interesting happens. essentially no
acetylcholine. Acetylcholine production release action two major sites,
brainstem, nucleus parabigerminal nucleus,
really wanna know, forebrain, nucleus basalis. don't need
know names like, put there. Acetylcholine
production plummets. just almost zero. acetylcholine just mentioned,
associated focus. can think slow wave sleep big sweeping
waves activity brain kind distortion space time,
not really focusing one thing. Now molecules active
time norepinephrine. little bit surprising 'cause normally waking
states norepinephrine gonna associated lot alertness desire
move. not ton norepinephrine around slow wave sleep,
around. something associated movement circuitry going slow
wave sleep. remember, happening mostly beginning night,
sleep dominated slow wave sleep. no acetylcholine, little norepinephrine,
although lot serotonin. serotonin associated
desire, sensation kind bliss wellbeing, not lot movement.
sleep tend not move. Now slow wave sleep can move, not
paralyzed. can roll over. people going sleep walk, typically going
slow wave sleep. studies shown

13:00 Motor Learning

kind sadistic experiments people deprived specifically slow wave sleep,


can done waking soon electrode recording show
slow wave sleep chemically altering sleep biases
away slow wave sleep. studies shown motor learning generally
occurring slow wave sleep. say day go sleep
learning new dance move, learning specific motor skill, either
fine motor skill course motor skill. say, new form exercise
new coordinated movements. coordinate movement level
fingers, coordinated movement level whole body large limb
movements. involve people, solo activity. Learning
skills happening primarily slow wave sleep early part night.
addition, slow wave sleep shown important learning detailed
information. Now isn't always cognitive information. gonna talk cognitive
information, studies done along lines involve people
learn detailed information specific rules way certain words
spelled, tend challenging words. people tested terms
performance types exams deprived slow wave sleep,
tend perform poorly. can think slow wave sleep important
motor learning, motor skill learning learning specific details specific

slow wave sleep primarily early part night, motor learning occurring
primarily early night, detailed learning occurring early night. Now
waking three, four hours sleep, might
informative. might tell little something able learn
not able learn sleep get. Although, hopefully
not sleep get. going dive deep one can
maximize motor learning order extract say, detail information
coordinated movements make faster slower. might
important certain sports. might almost certainly important certain sports.
gonna important kind coordinated movement, like say learning play
piano, instance, learn synchronized movements somebody else.
maybe mentioned example dance earlier. Like years ago, set
learn tango Argentine relatives Bismal. need
return point. just Bismal. one worst things
bismal learning dance that, somebody else suffer consequences


also. don't know maybe month neuroplasticity, explore
self experimentation. But, key things know slow wave sleep involved
motor learning detailed learning. no acetylcholine around time,
big amplitude activity sweeping throughout brain release
neuromodulators, norepinephrine serotonin.

16:30 High Performance Less Sleep

again, happening early night. athletes, people concerned
performance, happen wake just couple hours of, know,
three, four hours sleep excited competition next day,
presumably already trained skills need event
fine engage particular activity. Now always going better get full
night's sleep. that, know, full night's sleep six hours always
gonna better get sleep get less. However, think people get
little bit overly concerned didn't get full night's sleep sort
physical event performance going plummet. Presumably,
already learned need do, stored neural circuits know
make coordinated movements, literature slow wave sleep
suggest replenished. motor learning recovery
exercise going happen early night. Okay. just pause there, kind
shelve moment gonna come back it. wanna talk
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep, mentioned before, occurs throughout night, gonna
it.

17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep

larger percentage 90 minute sleep cycles going comprised REM
sleep get toward morning. REM sleep fascinating. discovered '50s
sleep laboratory Chicago, researchers observed people's eyes
moving eyelids. Now, something important going address
talk trauma later that, eye movements not just side side
erratic different directions. One thing don't think never heard


anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.

interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling

therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.


legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.

REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move

navigate city environment, place doesn't be,
know, scale city. can new building. finding particular rooms,
new social interaction. experience important enough, becomes
solidified days later won't forget it. unimportant, probably forget


it. REM sleep literal replay exact firing neurons

seems involved generation detailed spatial information. But,
actually happening REM sleep? uncoupling emotion,
happening REM sleep forming relationship particular

general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

08:10 Chemical Cocktails Sleep

surprising similarity lot dream states yet really important
differences. Okay. start talking slow wave sleep, non REM sleep.
realized slow wave sleep non REM sleep aren't exactly thing.
sleep aficionados there, lumping right now. say science,
lumpers splitters both. Sometimes lump, sometimes
split. sake clarity ease conversation right now gonna lumper.
say slow wave sleep, mean non REM sleep generally. Although, acknowledge
distinction. Slow wave sleep. slow wave sleep characterized
particular pattern brain activity brain metabolically active,
big sweeping waves activity include lot brain. wanna
look can find evidence sweeping waves neural activity across
association cortex, across big swaths brainstem, so-called pons geniculate
occipital pathway. brainstem, thalamus, cortex
interested. Although, going occur REM sleep. Now interesting
thing slow wave sleep neuromodulators tend associated it,
active least active slow wave sleep why. remind
neuromodulators chemicals act rather slowly main role
bias particular brain circuits active brain circuits not active.
like music playlist. think neuromodulators come names of,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, think suggesting
playlists audio device. So, know, classical music distinctly different feel
tone number features like third wave punk, from, know,
hip hop, right? think biasing toward particular genres neural circuit
activity, okay. Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music, rhythmic music


includes lyrics versus rhythmic music doesn't include lyrics. less way
think neuromodulators. associated consequence
certain brain functions. know instance just review, acetylcholine
waking states neuromodulator tends amplify activity brain circuits
associated focus attention. Norepinephrine neuromodulator tends
amplify brain circuits associated alertness, desire move. Serotonin
neuromodulator released intense amplify circuits brain body
associated bliss desire remain still. dopamine
neuromodulator released associated amplification neural circuits
brain body associated pursuing goals pleasure reward. Okay.
slow wave sleep something really interesting happens. essentially no
acetylcholine. Acetylcholine production release action two major sites,
brainstem, nucleus parabigerminal nucleus,
really wanna know, forebrain, nucleus basalis. don't need
know names like, put there. Acetylcholine
production plummets. just almost zero. acetylcholine just mentioned,
associated focus. can think slow wave sleep big sweeping
waves activity brain kind distortion space time,
not really focusing one thing. Now molecules active
time norepinephrine. little bit surprising 'cause normally waking
states norepinephrine gonna associated lot alertness desire
move. not ton norepinephrine around slow wave sleep,
around. something associated movement circuitry going slow
wave sleep. remember, happening mostly beginning night,
sleep dominated slow wave sleep. no acetylcholine, little norepinephrine,
although lot serotonin. serotonin associated
desire, sensation kind bliss wellbeing, not lot movement.
sleep tend not move. Now slow wave sleep can move, not
paralyzed. can roll over. people going sleep walk, typically going
slow wave sleep. studies shown

13:00 Motor Learning

kind sadistic experiments people deprived specifically slow wave sleep,


can done waking soon electrode recording show
slow wave sleep chemically altering sleep biases
away slow wave sleep. studies shown motor learning generally
occurring slow wave sleep. say day go sleep
learning new dance move, learning specific motor skill, either
fine motor skill course motor skill. say, new form exercise
new coordinated movements. coordinate movement level
fingers, coordinated movement level whole body large limb
movements. involve people, solo activity. Learning
skills happening primarily slow wave sleep early part night.
addition, slow wave sleep shown important learning detailed
information. Now isn't always cognitive information. gonna talk cognitive
information, studies done along lines involve people
learn detailed information specific rules way certain words
spelled, tend challenging words. people tested terms
performance types exams deprived slow wave sleep,
tend perform poorly. can think slow wave sleep important
motor learning, motor skill learning learning specific details specific
events. turns fundamentally important now know
slow wave sleep primarily early part night, motor learning occurring
primarily early night, detailed learning occurring early night. Now
waking three, four hours sleep, might
informative. might tell little something able learn
not able learn sleep get. Although, hopefully
not sleep get. going dive deep one can
maximize motor learning order extract say, detail information
coordinated movements make faster slower. might
important certain sports. might almost certainly important certain sports.
gonna important kind coordinated movement, like say learning play
piano, instance, learn synchronized movements somebody else.
maybe mentioned example dance earlier. Like years ago, set
learn tango Argentine relatives Bismal. need
return point. just Bismal. one worst things
bismal learning dance that, somebody else suffer consequences


also. don't know maybe month neuroplasticity, explore
self experimentation. But, key things know slow wave sleep involved
motor learning detailed learning. no acetylcholine around time,
big amplitude activity sweeping throughout brain release
neuromodulators, norepinephrine serotonin.

16:30 High Performance Less Sleep

again, happening early night. athletes, people concerned
performance, happen wake just couple hours of, know,
three, four hours sleep excited competition next day,
presumably already trained skills need event
fine engage particular activity. Now always going better get full
night's sleep. that, know, full night's sleep six hours always
gonna better get sleep get less. However, think people get
little bit overly concerned didn't get full night's sleep sort
physical event performance going plummet. Presumably,
already learned need do, stored neural circuits know
make coordinated movements, literature slow wave sleep
suggest replenished. motor learning recovery
exercise going happen early night. Okay. just pause there, kind
shelve moment gonna come back it. wanna talk
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep, mentioned before, occurs throughout night, gonna
it.

17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep

larger percentage 90 minute sleep cycles going comprised REM
sleep get toward morning. REM sleep fascinating. discovered '50s
sleep laboratory Chicago, researchers observed people's eyes
moving eyelids. Now, something important going address
talk trauma later that, eye movements not just side side
erratic different directions. One thing don't think never heard


anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.
thing people experience,

24:45 REM & Waking Collide

certainly experience, waking feeling stressed whatever
happen thinking about, dreaming moments before.
interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling
daytime, repeating experience sleep, epinephrine not available,
therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.


legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back

body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM

REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move

general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information

duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing

almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't

isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,

children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.

includes lyrics versus rhythmic music doesn't include lyrics. less way
think neuromodulators. associated consequence
certain brain functions. know instance just review, acetylcholine
waking states neuromodulator tends amplify activity brain circuits
associated focus attention. Norepinephrine neuromodulator tends
amplify brain circuits associated alertness, desire move. Serotonin
neuromodulator released intense amplify circuits brain body
associated bliss desire remain still. dopamine
neuromodulator released associated amplification neural circuits
brain body associated pursuing goals pleasure reward. Okay.
slow wave sleep something really interesting happens. essentially no
acetylcholine. Acetylcholine production release action two major sites,
brainstem, nucleus parabigerminal nucleus,
really wanna know, forebrain, nucleus basalis. don't need
know names like, put there. Acetylcholine
production plummets. just almost zero. acetylcholine just mentioned,
associated focus. can think slow wave sleep big sweeping
waves activity brain kind distortion space time,
not really focusing one thing. Now molecules active
time norepinephrine. little bit surprising 'cause normally waking
states norepinephrine gonna associated lot alertness desire
move. not ton norepinephrine around slow wave sleep,
around. something associated movement circuitry going slow
wave sleep. remember, happening mostly beginning night,
sleep dominated slow wave sleep. no acetylcholine, little norepinephrine,
although lot serotonin. serotonin associated
desire, sensation kind bliss wellbeing, not lot movement.
sleep tend not move. Now slow wave sleep can move, not
paralyzed. can roll over. people going sleep walk, typically going
slow wave sleep. studies shown

13:00 Motor Learning

kind sadistic experiments people deprived specifically slow wave sleep,


can done waking soon electrode recording show
slow wave sleep chemically altering sleep biases
away slow wave sleep. studies shown motor learning generally
occurring slow wave sleep. say day go sleep
learning new dance move, learning specific motor skill, either
fine motor skill course motor skill. say, new form exercise
new coordinated movements. coordinate movement level
fingers, coordinated movement level whole body large limb
movements. involve people, solo activity. Learning
skills happening primarily slow wave sleep early part night.
addition, slow wave sleep shown important learning detailed
information. Now isn't always cognitive information. gonna talk cognitive
information, studies done along lines involve people
learn detailed information specific rules way certain words
spelled, tend challenging words. people tested terms
performance types exams deprived slow wave sleep,
tend perform poorly. can think slow wave sleep important
motor learning, motor skill learning learning specific details specific
events. turns fundamentally important now know
slow wave sleep primarily early part night, motor learning occurring
primarily early night, detailed learning occurring early night. Now
waking three, four hours sleep, might
informative. might tell little something able learn
not able learn sleep get. Although, hopefully
not sleep get. going dive deep one can
maximize motor learning order extract say, detail information
coordinated movements make faster slower. might
important certain sports. might almost certainly important certain sports.
gonna important kind coordinated movement, like say learning play
piano, instance, learn synchronized movements somebody else.
maybe mentioned example dance earlier. Like years ago, set
learn tango Argentine relatives Bismal. need
return point. just Bismal. one worst things
bismal learning dance that, somebody else suffer consequences


also. don't know maybe month neuroplasticity, explore
self experimentation. But, key things know slow wave sleep involved
motor learning detailed learning. no acetylcholine around time,
big amplitude activity sweeping throughout brain release
neuromodulators, norepinephrine serotonin.

16:30 High Performance Less Sleep

again, happening early night. athletes, people concerned
performance, happen wake just couple hours of, know,
three, four hours sleep excited competition next day,
presumably already trained skills need event
fine engage particular activity. Now always going better get full
night's sleep. that, know, full night's sleep six hours always
gonna better get sleep get less. However, think people get
little bit overly concerned didn't get full night's sleep sort
physical event performance going plummet. Presumably,
already learned need do, stored neural circuits know
make coordinated movements, literature slow wave sleep
suggest replenished. motor learning recovery
exercise going happen early night. Okay. just pause there, kind
shelve moment gonna come back it. wanna talk
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep, mentioned before, occurs throughout night, gonna
it.

17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep

larger percentage 90 minute sleep cycles going comprised REM
sleep get toward morning. REM sleep fascinating. discovered '50s
sleep laboratory Chicago, researchers observed people's eyes
moving eyelids. Now, something important going address
talk trauma later that, eye movements not just side side
erratic different directions. One thing don't think never heard


anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.
thing people experience,

24:45 REM & Waking Collide

certainly experience, waking feeling stressed whatever
happen thinking about, dreaming moments before.
interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling
daytime, repeating experience sleep, epinephrine not available,
therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.


legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move

navigate city environment, place doesn't be,
know, scale city. can new building. finding particular rooms,
new social interaction. experience important enough, becomes
solidified days later won't forget it. unimportant, probably forget


it. REM sleep literal replay exact firing neurons

general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing

almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't

Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.

can done waking soon electrode recording show
slow wave sleep chemically altering sleep biases
away slow wave sleep. studies shown motor learning generally
occurring slow wave sleep. say day go sleep
learning new dance move, learning specific motor skill, either
fine motor skill course motor skill. say, new form exercise
new coordinated movements. coordinate movement level
fingers, coordinated movement level whole body large limb
movements. involve people, solo activity. Learning
skills happening primarily slow wave sleep early part night.
addition, slow wave sleep shown important learning detailed
information. Now isn't always cognitive information. gonna talk cognitive
information, studies done along lines involve people
learn detailed information specific rules way certain words
spelled, tend challenging words. people tested terms
performance types exams deprived slow wave sleep,
tend perform poorly. can think slow wave sleep important
motor learning, motor skill learning learning specific details specific
events. turns fundamentally important now know
slow wave sleep primarily early part night, motor learning occurring
primarily early night, detailed learning occurring early night. Now
waking three, four hours sleep, might
informative. might tell little something able learn
not able learn sleep get. Although, hopefully
not sleep get. going dive deep one can
maximize motor learning order extract say, detail information
coordinated movements make faster slower. might
important certain sports. might almost certainly important certain sports.
gonna important kind coordinated movement, like say learning play
piano, instance, learn synchronized movements somebody else.
maybe mentioned example dance earlier. Like years ago, set
learn tango Argentine relatives Bismal. need
return point. just Bismal. one worst things
bismal learning dance that, somebody else suffer consequences


also. don't know maybe month neuroplasticity, explore
self experimentation. But, key things know slow wave sleep involved
motor learning detailed learning. no acetylcholine around time,
big amplitude activity sweeping throughout brain release
neuromodulators, norepinephrine serotonin.

16:30 High Performance Less Sleep

again, happening early night. athletes, people concerned
performance, happen wake just couple hours of, know,
three, four hours sleep excited competition next day,
presumably already trained skills need event
fine engage particular activity. Now always going better get full
night's sleep. that, know, full night's sleep six hours always
gonna better get sleep get less. However, think people get
little bit overly concerned didn't get full night's sleep sort
physical event performance going plummet. Presumably,
already learned need do, stored neural circuits know
make coordinated movements, literature slow wave sleep
suggest replenished. motor learning recovery
exercise going happen early night. Okay. just pause there, kind
shelve moment gonna come back it. wanna talk
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep, mentioned before, occurs throughout night, gonna
it.

17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep

larger percentage 90 minute sleep cycles going comprised REM
sleep get toward morning. REM sleep fascinating. discovered '50s
sleep laboratory Chicago, researchers observed people's eyes
moving eyelids. Now, something important going address
talk trauma later that, eye movements not just side side
erratic different directions. One thing don't think never heard


anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.
thing people experience,

24:45 REM & Waking Collide

certainly experience, waking feeling stressed whatever
happen thinking about, dreaming moments before.
interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling
daytime, repeating experience sleep, epinephrine not available,
therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.


legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human

clear agreed upon association computers information

duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason

emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,

much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.

also. don't know maybe month neuroplasticity, explore
self experimentation. But, key things know slow wave sleep involved
motor learning detailed learning. no acetylcholine around time,
big amplitude activity sweeping throughout brain release
neuromodulators, norepinephrine serotonin.

16:30 High Performance Less Sleep

again, happening early night. athletes, people concerned
performance, happen wake just couple hours of, know,
three, four hours sleep excited competition next day,
presumably already trained skills need event
fine engage particular activity. Now always going better get full
night's sleep. that, know, full night's sleep six hours always
gonna better get sleep get less. However, think people get
little bit overly concerned didn't get full night's sleep sort
physical event performance going plummet. Presumably,
already learned need do, stored neural circuits know
make coordinated movements, literature slow wave sleep
suggest replenished. motor learning recovery
exercise going happen early night. Okay. just pause there, kind
shelve moment gonna come back it. wanna talk
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep, mentioned before, occurs throughout night, gonna
it.

17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep

larger percentage 90 minute sleep cycles going comprised REM
sleep get toward morning. REM sleep fascinating. discovered '50s
sleep laboratory Chicago, researchers observed people's eyes
moving eyelids. Now, something important going address
talk trauma later that, eye movements not just side side
erratic different directions. One thing don't think never heard


anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.
thing people experience,

24:45 REM & Waking Collide

certainly experience, waking feeling stressed whatever
happen thinking about, dreaming moments before.
interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling
daytime, repeating experience sleep, epinephrine not available,
therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.

two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information

duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't

isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,

much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings

uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,

anyone really talk publicly is, eye movements sleep, right? Eyes
closed. sometimes people's eyelids will little bit open eyes darting
around, especially little kids. don't suggest this. not even sure ethical.
But, done you, know, pull back eyelids kid
sleeping eyes kind darting place. think people
passed friends parties things like that. again, don't suggest it,
telling done therefore don't
again. rapid eye movement sleep fascinating occurs
connections brainstem, area called pons, areas thalamus
top brain stem involved generating movements different
directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes rapid eye
movement sleep not just rapid, kind jittery side side thing
eyeballs kind role. really pretty creepy look see. happening
circuitry involved conscious eye movements kind going
haywire, not haywire. waves activity brainstem so-
called thalamus, area filter sensory information
cortex. cortex course, involved conscious perceptions. rapid eye
movement sleep couple things happening besides rapid eye
movements. main ones they're, say, contrast slow wave sleep.
REM sleep serotonin essentially absent. Okay? molecule,
neuromodulator tends create feeling bliss wellbeing just calm
placidity absent. right. interesting. addition that, norepinephrine
molecule involved movement alertness absolutely absent. probably
one times life epinephrin essentially zero activity within
system. number important implications sorts dreaming
occur REM sleep sorts learning can occur REM sleep
unlearning.

20:30 Paralysis & Hallucinations

First REM sleep, paralyzed. experiencing called atonia,
just means completely laid paralyzed. also tend
experience whatever dreaming kind hallucination,
hallucinatory activity. Long ago looked hallucinations dreaming just


fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed
can't move chased. lot people said, "Oh, must REM
sleep." paralyzed dreaming paralyzed
can't move. think probably false. research says no
epinephrine absent REM sleep, unlikely can
intense, fearful memories. probably occurring slow wave sleep.
Although, might instances people nightmares REM sleep.
thing people experience,

24:45 REM & Waking Collide

certainly experience, waking feeling stressed whatever
happen thinking about, dreaming moments before.
interesting case invasion

25:00 Sleeping Awake

dream state waking state moment wake epinephrine
available. research isn't fully crystallized, points
direction experience waking feeling panicked. Maybe, wanna
highlight may, maybe experiencing something troubling
daytime, repeating experience sleep, epinephrine not available,
therefore brain circuits associated fear anxiety shut off.
able process events suddenly wake surge
adrenaline epinephrin now coupled experience. nightmares likely
slow wave sleep kind panic waking something likely
invasion thoughts ideas, however distorted REM sleep invading waking
state. fact, brings mind something mentioned before, wanna
mention again, atonia, paralysis experience sleep can invade
waking state. Many people report experience waking paralyzed.


legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move
one place another. common world scenario, go new place,
navigate city environment, place doesn't be,
know, scale city. can new building. finding particular rooms,
new social interaction. experience important enough, becomes
solidified days later won't forget it. unimportant, probably forget


it. REM sleep literal replay exact firing neurons
occurred navigating city building earlier. REM sleep
seems involved generation detailed spatial information. But,
actually happening REM sleep? uncoupling emotion,
happening REM sleep forming relationship particular
rules algorithms. starting figure based experience
day, whether not important avoid certain people
approach certain people, whether not important that, know, enter
building go elevator turn left bathroom is, instance.
general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.

fascinated high school. great books
interested exploring relationship hallucinations dreaming.
famous guy, researcher Harvard, Alan Hobson, know, wrote
book called, Dream Drug Store. talked similarities drugs
induce hallucinations dreaming REM. can explore like.
REM eyes moving, rest body paralyzed
hallucinating. no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just create desire
move alertness. also chemical signature fear anxiety.
released adrenal glands experience something fearful
alerting. car suddenly screeches front us, get troubling text
message, adrenaline deployed system. Adrenaline epinephrin,
equivalent molecules. epinephrin isn't just released adrenals also
released within brain. weird stage life happens
toward morning, call REM sleep, hallucinating
outrageous experiences mind, chemical associated fear
panic anxiety not available us. turns important.
can imagine important. important allows us experience
things, replay things occur well elaborate contortions things
didn't occur. allows us experience absence fear anxiety,
turns important adjusting emotional relationship challenging
things happened us awake. challenging things can
sometimes form social anxiety, just working hard
concern upcoming event, sometimes people report instance, dreams
find late exam, naked public, sort
situation troubling them. almost certainly occurs
REM sleep. incredible period sleep experience
emotionally laid events dissociated. chemically blocked us
actual emotion. Now probably immediately thinking,

23:35 Nightmares

"Well, nightmares? nightmares carry lot emotion,
sometimes wake panic." consider two things separately
important understanding REM sleep. good chance


nightmares occurring slow wave sleep. actually drugs don't
suggest people take. fact much not gonna mention give people
kind scary eerie dreams kind feeling things pursuing them,
can't move chased. actually common dream
had. guess, less nightmare. feeling one paralyzed

yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move
one place another. common world scenario, go new place,
navigate city environment, place doesn't be,
know, scale city. can new building. finding particular rooms,
new social interaction. experience important enough, becomes
solidified days later won't forget it. unimportant, probably forget


it. REM sleep literal replay exact firing neurons
occurred navigating city building earlier. REM sleep
seems involved generation detailed spatial information. But,
actually happening REM sleep? uncoupling emotion,
happening REM sleep forming relationship particular
rules algorithms. starting figure based experience
day, whether not important avoid certain people
approach certain people, whether not important that, know, enter
building go elevator turn left bathroom is, instance.
general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.
maps beautiful data studies initiated guy named Matt
Wilson MIT years ago. Showing rodents turns non-human
primates humans replay spacial information REM sleep,
almost precisely maps activity experienced day move
one place another. common world scenario, go new place,
navigate city environment, place doesn't be,
know, scale city. can new building. finding particular rooms,
new social interaction. experience important enough, becomes
solidified days later won't forget it. unimportant, probably forget


it. REM sleep literal replay exact firing neurons
occurred navigating city building earlier. REM sleep
seems involved generation detailed spatial information. But,
actually happening REM sleep? uncoupling emotion,
happening REM sleep forming relationship particular
rules algorithms. starting figure based experience
day, whether not important avoid certain people
approach certain people, whether not important that, know, enter
building go elevator turn left bathroom is, instance.
general themes things locations fit together
word called meaning.

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,

legitimately waking up, not dream. Waking paralyzed,
terrifying. happen before. can tell terrifying wide awake,
far tell fully conscious, unable move. generally can
jolt seconds, quite frightening. Now people
actually experience waking up, fully paralyzed hallucinating.
theory academic scientific community least,

26:45 Alien Abductions

people report alien abductions certain number core
characteristics map quite closely, yearly similarly experiences. lot
reports alien abduction involve people unable move, seeing particular faces,
hallucinating, extensively feeling like body floating, transported.
similar experience invasion atonia waking state, waking
still paralyzed. well hallucinations characteristic dreaming
REM sleep. Now not saying people's alien abductions not legitimate
alien abductions, I, wasn't there. wouldn't tell 'cause
make alien, wouldn't want know. quite possible
people experiencing things invasion sleep state
waking state can last several minutes longer. dreams,
space time distorted, perception events lasted
many hours can really feel lasted many hours, fact took
moments. gonna return distortion space time little bit.
just recap gone far. Slow wave sleep early night. shown
important motor learning detailed learning. REM sleep certain dream
component no epinephrin, therefore can't experience anxiety,
paralyzed. dreams tend really vivid lot detail them.
yet REM sleep clear sorts learning happened REM
sleep not motor events. unlearning emotional events. now
know why, chemicals available really feeling emotions not
present. Now important implications. address implications
two sides. First ask, happens don't get enough REM
sleep? scenario happens lot people don't get enough REM sleep
following. just explain one familiar



29:00 Irritability

'cause happens lot, although figured ways adjust. go sleep around
10:30, 11:00, fall asleep easily wake around 3:00 4:00 AM. now
know use NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol allows fall back
asleep. Even though called non sleep depressed really allows relax
body brain, tend fall back asleep sleep till 7:00 AM.
time get lot REM sleep. know measured it, know
dreams tend intense sort know typical REM
sleep. scenario, gotten slow wave sleep early night got
REM sleep toward morning. However, times don't go back sleep,
maybe flight catch, happened. Sometimes got lot mind
don't go back sleep. can tell you, probably experienced

30:00 Sleep Delete

lack REM sleep tends make people emotionally irritable. tends make us
feel little things big things. clear laboratory studies
people deprived selectively REM sleep, emotionality tends
get little bit unhinged tend catastrophize small things. tend feel like
world really daunting, never gonna move forward ways want.
can't unlearn emotional components whatever happening,
even not traumatic. thing happens REM sleep replay certain
types spatial information places.

important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,

seems involved generation detailed spatial information. But,
actually happening REM sleep? uncoupling emotion,

32:25 Creating Meaning

day experiencing sorts things. Meaning
individually piece together relevance one thing next, right? suddenly
told that, know, pen downloading information brain
important deliver information, probably think pretty strange
character. typically don't think pens downloading information
brains. told getting information computer allowing
say things you, say, "Well, perfectly reasonable."
clear agreed upon association computers information
memory, don't association pens. might say, "Well,
duh." something brain needs solidify relationships make sure
certain relationships don't exist. appears REM sleep important that,
deprive people REM start seeing odd
associations, tend lump batch things. know experience
ever sleep deprived, unfortunately happens often
terrible deadlines, pull all-nighter, word starts look like spelled
incorrectly. simple word spell, things start look little distorted.
know people deprived REM sleep long periods time,
start hallucinating. literally start seeing relationships movement objects
isn't happening. REM sleep really establish emotional load,
also, start discarding meanings irrelevant. think


emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive

next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can

1:15:50 Corrections

get 20% off anything provide. Last not least, people wrote
questions/corrections things said previous podcasts.
keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.
thing said, one point said, "Typical temperature 96.8 actually
meant say 98.6." dyslexic slip part apologize. don't know
dyslexic. know haven't clinically diagnosed dyslexia, swapped
them, sometimes happens going fast. apologize. use
moment just say temperature varies lot across day night, theme
previous podcasts. can't really talk average temperature anyway,
want clear

1:17:25 Closing Remarks

people think average temperature 98.6. misspoke, error
apologize. Thank joining journey nervous system biology
trying understand mechanisms make us function
sleep wakefulness. really incredible landscape consider hope
getting lot information. always thank interest

emotionality, lot emotionality catastrophizing

34:10 Adults Acting Like Children

seeing problems everywhere. imagine might occur
start linking web experience extensively. important order
healthy, emotional, cognitive functioning fairly narrow channels
individual things. see something news troubling, well,
makes sense troubled. troubled everything start
just saying, know, "Everything bothering feeling highly irritable
everything just distorting troubling me." Chances not actively removing
meaning, connectivity life experiences well
almost always maps back deficit REM sleep. REM sleep powerful
amazing capacity eliminate meanings don't matter. not
exacerbates meanings matter, eliminates meanings don't
matter. bears striking resemblance happens early development.
isn't discussion early development, early development reason
baby can't generate coordinated movements, reason children can get
emotional seems like trivial events, adults know trivial events.
Like, "Oh, ice cream shop closed." kid just dissolves into, know,
puddle tears parents say, "Okay, well, it'll open another time."
children one reasons can't generate coordinated movement,
place ice cream shop closed larger context,
much connectivity. much maturation brain nervous system
brings us point emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings
elimination connections things. REM sleep seems
uncouple potential emotionality various experiences. brings us
absolutely fundamental relationship similarity REM sleep
clinical practices designed eliminate emotionality

36:20 Trauma & REM

help people move trauma troubling experiences, whether not
troubling experiences death family close loved one, something


terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

terrible happened somebody else, or, know, entire childhood
event mind body felt experienced as, bad, terrible,
concerning. Many perhaps heard trauma treatment EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, ketamine treatment trauma. Something
recently became legal fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough,
EMDR ketamine kind core level, bear similar features REM sleep.
talk EMDR first.

37:15 EMDR

EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing something developed
psychologist, Francine Shapiro. actually Palo Alto. story goes
walking, not incidentally, trees forest behind Stanford,
recalling troubling event mind. life.
realized walking, emotional load experience not
intense severe. extrapolated experience walking not feeling
stressed stressful event practice put work clients,
patients, now become fairly widespread. actually one
behavior treatments approved American Psychological Association
treatment trauma. clients patients move eyes
side side recounting traumatic troubling event. Now
course clinic. guessing removed walking component just
took eye movement component clinic nice go
therapy sessions therapist take walks certain boundaries
as, confidentiality. know, lot people around person might not
feel open discussing things, weather barriers things like that, know,
raining hailing outside, gets tough do. eye movements? Well, never
really said eye movements. But, soon tell decision select
lateralized eye movements work clinic right one. eye
movements, look silly. here.

39:10 Demo

look silly, basically involve sitting chair moving one's eyes


side side, not talking. But, know, it's... recounting events.
sometimes talking moving eyes, usually moving eyes
side side 30, 60 seconds, describing challenging procedure. Now
vision scientist also works stress first heard this, thought crazy,
frankly. People ask EMDR just thought, "That's crazy." went
looked theories EMDR might work bunch
theories. "Oh, mimics eye movements REM sleep." one. turns
not true explain why. one was, "Oh, synchronizes
activity two sides brain." Well, sort of, mean, look
sides binocular visual field activate visual cortex. But, whole idea
synchrony two sides brain something think modern
neuroscience starting to, just say, gently not gently move away from.
whole right brain, left brain business. turns however, eye movements
sort just Francine Shapiro took walk experience brought
clients clinic, sorts eye movements generate whenever
moving space, self-generating movement. not
much driving car, certainly riding bicycle,
walking running, don't realize reflexive
subconscious eye movements go side side, associated
motor system. move forward eyes go like this. There've
number studies showing lateralized eye movements helped people move
dissociate emotional experience particular traumas
experiences, recall experiences treatment not
feel stressed them, didn't report traumatic longer. Now
success rate wasn't 100%, statistically significant number studies.
yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature

yet still critics EMDR. frankly, long time still thought,
"Well, don't know. just seems like kind hack." just seems like kind
something don't know mechanism, can't explain,
last five years, no fewer five sixth way, high
quality peer reviewed manuscripts published Journal Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell
Press Journal, Excellent Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. stringent
journals papers showing lateralized eye movements sort just did,
just listening just moving eyes side side eyes
open. eye movements not vertical eye movements suppress activity


amygdala, brain region involved threat detection, stress,
anxiety, fear. forms fear not amygdala dependent,
amygdala not fear center, critical fear response
experience anxiety. interesting. got clinical tool now indeed
shows lot success good number people, eye movements side
side suppressing amygdala. general theme use eye
movements suppress fear response, recount repeat experience
time uncouple heavy emotional load, sadness, depression,
anxiety, fear whatever happened traumatic.
important understand because, know, love able tell somebody
traumatic experience forget experience, truth
never forget traumatic experience. remove emotional load.
Eventually really lose potency. emotional potency alleviated. Now
EMDR just mention, tends successful single event
specific kinds trauma happened over, opposed say entire
childhood entire divorce. tends effective single event kinds
things, car crashes, et cetera, people can really recall events quite lot
detail. not everybody done... going done trauma
done clinical setting somebody certified this.
bears lot resemblance REM sleep, right? experience sleep
eyes moving, excuse me, although different way, don't chemical
epinephrine order generate fear response, yet remembering
event previous day days. Sometimes REM sleep think things
happened long time ago. interesting. now new
treatment, chemical treatment drug ketamine, also bears lot
resemblance

44:25 Ketamine / PCP

sorts things happen REM sleep. Ketamine getting lot attention now.
think lot people just don't realize ketamine is. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. remarkably similar drug called PCP, certainly hazardous
drug people use. Ketamine PCP function disrupt activity
particular receptor brain called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can

leave rating, well comments feel podcast.
suggest podcast friends coworkers anyone else think
benefit information also really helps us get word out.
course, check sponsors direct way help us continue
get information general public. Many asked
supplements personally get supplements. partnered Thorne
get supplements Thorne because, view highest level
stringency precision terms bottle. also high
quality standards. partnered Mayo Clinic major sports

Thorne spelled thorne.com/u/huberman. can see formulations
take. also get 20% off, not just formulations, anything
Thorne makes. thorne.com/u/huberman

1:15:50 Corrections

get 20% off anything provide. Last not least, people wrote
questions/corrections things said previous podcasts.
keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.
thing said, one point said, "Typical temperature 96.8 actually
meant say 98.6." dyslexic slip part apologize. don't know
dyslexic. know haven't clinically diagnosed dyslexia, swapped
them, sometimes happens going fast. apologize. use
moment just say temperature varies lot across day night, theme
previous podcasts. can't really talk average temperature anyway,
want clear

1:17:25 Closing Remarks

people think average temperature 98.6. misspoke, error
apologize. Thank joining journey nervous system biology
trying understand mechanisms make us function

reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,
experiencing? theory mind something emerges early life part
maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not
chances slow wave sleep. Today deep dive sleep
dreaming, learning unlearning. just want recap highlights
important points. lot slow wave sleep less REM early night, REM
less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.


apologize behalf. said, welcome video podcast integral
part podcast. people said, "Hey,

1:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer

noise background really disruptive." Hey, can say? Costello ten-
year-old bulldog mastiff. lifespan animals 10 years. not
trying make feel guilty, but, know, gone won't snoring,
although probably get different dog. sort a, kids say, sorry not
sorry. Sorry not sorry snoring sorry disruptive genuinely,
hall.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can
help support Huberman Lab Podcast greatly appreciate question.
can help support podcast subscribing YouTube channel, haven't
already leaving comments questions comment section.
subscribe Apple Spotify, helpful. place Apple Podcasts
leave rating, well comments feel podcast.
suggest podcast friends coworkers anyone else think
benefit information also really helps us get word out.
course, check sponsors direct way help us continue
get information general public. Many asked
supplements personally get supplements. partnered Thorne
get supplements Thorne because, view highest level
stringency precision terms bottle. also high
quality standards. partnered Mayo Clinic major sports
organizations. wanna try Thorne supplements can go thorne.com.
Thorne spelled thorne.com/u/huberman. can see formulations
take. also get 20% off, not just formulations, anything
Thorne makes. thorne.com/u/huberman

1:15:50 Corrections

get 20% off anything provide. Last not least, people wrote
questions/corrections things said previous podcasts.
keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.
thing said, one point said, "Typical temperature 96.8 actually
meant say 98.6." dyslexic slip part apologize. don't know
dyslexic. know haven't clinically diagnosed dyslexia, swapped
them, sometimes happens going fast. apologize. use
moment just say temperature varies lot across day night, theme
previous podcasts. can't really talk average temperature anyway,
want clear

1:17:25 Closing Remarks

people think average temperature 98.6. misspoke, error
apologize. Thank joining journey nervous system biology
trying understand mechanisms make us function
sleep wakefulness. really incredible landscape consider hope
getting lot information. always thank interest
science.


receptor. receptor surface neurons surface neurons
time not active, something extreme happens
lot activity neural pathway impinges receptor, opens
allows entry molecules, ions trigger cellular process call long-term
potentiation. long-term potentiation translates change connectivity
later don't need intense event neuron become active again. Let
clarify little bit this. NMDA receptor gated intense experience.

45:45 Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

One way think is, typically walk home, might make
food sit kitchen table, don't think anything explosions.
come home one night, sit bowl chicken soup
massive explosion neurons associated chicken soup kitchen table
active way different previously, will
coupled experience explosions next time, perhaps every
time go sit kitchen table, no matter rational
origins explosion, maybe gas truck road no
reason think today, experience. neurons
will become active get increase heart rate. get increase sweating,
et cetera. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptor prevents crossover
addition meaning kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup
explosion experience. ketamine used? Ketamine used
prevent learning emotions soon trauma. ketamine stocked
number different emergency rooms, people brought quickly and,
know, hard describe even but, know, horrible experience
somebody seeing loved one next killed car accident driving
car. isn't everybody, certainly need talk physician,
ketamine used might infuse somebody ketamine
emotion can still occur, plasticity, change wiring brain
won't allow intense emotion attached experience. Now immediately
can imagine sort ethical implications this, right? certain emotions need
coupled experiences. not saying people using ketamine,
shouldn't using ketamine, certainly not recreationally quite dangerous. can


lethal like PCP can cause pretty dramatic changes perception behavior.
clinical setting basis ketamine assisted therapies really remove
emotion. think way hearing talked general public
lot people think little bit like kind psilocybin trials NMDA
trials, becoming emotional getting touch certain
experience. Ketamine becoming dissociative removed emotional
component experience. now ketamine, chemically blocks plasticity
prevents connection emotion experience.
pharmacologic intervention. EMDR, eye movement thing
designed suppress amygdala, designed remove emotionality
somebody recounts experience. REM sleep, chemical
epinephrin allows signaling intense emotion experience tense
emotion brain body not allowed. starting see organizational
logic, certain component sleeping life

48:55 Self Therapy

acting like therapy. really REM sleep about. really
think REM sleep slow wave sleep critical. Slow wave sleep motor
learning detailed learning. REM sleep attaching emotions particular
experiences. making sure emotions not attached wrong
experiences unlearning emotional responses intense severe.
speaks great importance mastering one sleep, something talked
episode two podcast. making sure life disruptive events,
either due travel stress, changes school hours food schedule, something
talked episodes three four, one can still grab hold
manage one sleep life. fundamentally unlearning emotions
troubling us allows us move forward life. indeed REM deprivation
studies show people become hyperemotional. start catastrophize.
no surprise therefore, sleep disturbances correlate many emotional
psychological disturbances. now just obvious will case.
fact, day discussion colleague mine
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. known two decades now time
Oxford.



50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.
powerful. means strive regular amount sleep.
us means falling asleep waking going back sleep. people
means falling asleep waking not getting back sleep. Now ideally,
getting full compliment slow wave sleep early night sleep toward morning,


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

59:50 Lucidity

fine detailed information not general rules, emotional components experiences.
interested lucid dreaming like increase
amount lucid dreaming experiencing, haven't able track
device red light described beginning, number just
simple zero technology tools one use principle. One set queue.
way works come simple statement something like
see, experience later dreams. can, instance, write down, know,
something like, want remember red apple. know sounds silly trivial,


look probably wanna write piece paper. might
even want draw red apple, go sleep look
just go sleep. reports several days
row can lead situation suddenly dream
remember red apple, gives sort tether reality dream
state reality allows navigate shape kind adjust dreams.
Lucid dreaming not be, include ability alter features dream,
know, able control things dream. Sometimes just awareness
dreaming, nonetheless people enjoy lucid dreaming.
people lot lucid dreams feel kind overwhelmed those,
going involve trying embrace protocols can set right duration sleep.
little bit literature not lot shows keeping total amount sleep
per night say six hours begin sleep end beginning end
one ultradian cycles, can better waking middle one
ultradian cycles. try find right amount sleep need, right
you, try get consistently night night. lucid dreamer
don't like it, may want start make sure waking
end one ultradian cycles. case, better wake
six hours seven sleep longer six hours, maybe
wanna get seven half hours. 'Cause gonna reflect

1:02:15 Booze / Weed

end one 90 minute cycles, opposed waking middle.
Alcohol. Alcohol marijuana well known induce states pseudo sleep
like. Especially, people fall asleep consumed alcohol THC, one
active components marijuana. Alcohol, THC things like them, meaning
things increase serotonin, GABA going disrupt pattern sleep.
going disrupt depth. going disrupt overall sequencing slow
wave sleep early night REM sleep later night. just
reality. things least, studies find seem
suggest increase amount slow wave sleep using things like
arginine, amino acid arginine. Although, really wanna check. Arginine can
effects heart, et cetera effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna great


sleep depth sleep. might feel like can fall asleep faster, sleep
accessing really isn't kind deep restorative sleep getting.
Now, course, need order sleep within protocols,
said before, not suggesting people take anything. not medical doctor.
not cop. not trying irregulate anyone's behavior. just telling
literature says. may want explore dreams meaning
dreams, et cetera. know, not lot hard data this,

1:03:50 Scripting Dreams

lot people report keeping sleep journal, dream journal can
useful. mark think fell asleep night before, woke
wake middle night, early morning just write
can recall dreams. even recall nothing, many people
experience mid morning later afternoon suddenly comes
dream something writing down. kept dream journal
while. didn't really afford much. didn't really learn anything except dreams
bizarre. But, things happen dreams associated
REM sleep compared slow wave sleep, can tell whether not
dream likely happened REM sleep slow wave sleep. distinguishing feature
turns

1:04:35 Theory Mind

something called theory mind. Theory mind actually idea
developed study assessment autism. initially phrase,
theory mind, brought Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen,
comedians brother. Simon Baron Cohen psychologist extent
neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering

maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM
emotional unlearning associations particular life events. REM rich
sorts exploration emotional load chased, emotional load
take exam next day, late something. again,
fixated can recall thinking lot about, feeling lot

1:07:55 Synthesis

somebody else's motivations chances REM not

however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor

getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something

just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions

neuroscientist Oxford. theory mind tests done children. theory
mind test like following, child brought laboratory
watches video child playing sort toy. end playing
toy put toy drawer go away, another child
comes looking around experimenter asks child
experiment, real child says, "You know, child think? know,


feeling?" children particular age, five six older will
say, "Oh, know, confused, don't know toy is." Or,
say something implies call theory mind, can put ideas
mind child likely feeling experiencing. theory
mind. turns used one assessments autism,
children, not all, children autism go develop
autism don't theory mind. tend fixate fact first child
put toy drawer. say drawer opposed answering
question second child feel it,

maturation circuits brain associated emotional learning social
interactions. experienced certain dreams. dream
puzzled about, fixated thinking about, might ask,
"In dream assessing somebody else's emotion feeling, much
first person experience?" tendency theory mind tends
show REM associated dreams. Now isn't hard fast rule,
chances dream thinking people
wanted something you, thinking desire chase help
you, something related someone else's emotional experience.
probably REM dream. dream occurred rapid eye movement sleep opposed
slow wave sleep. makes sense think role REM

less slow wave sleep later night. REM sleep associated intense
experiences without chemical epinephrine allows us anxiety fear.


almost certainly important role uncoupling emotion experiences. Kind
self-induced therapy go night. bears striking resemblance
things like EMDR ketamine therapies forth. Slow wave sleep critical,
however, critical mostly motor learning learning specific details.
REM kind emotions general themes meaning, slow wave sleep, motor
learning details. personally find fascinating consistency sleep, meaning
getting six hours every night better getting ten one night, eight next, five
next, four next. find fascinating think also like something
can control better just trying sleep more, think not alone agreeing
just hard lot people do. episode also brings us
conclusion five episode streak focusing sleep transitions
sleep, non sleep depressed. talked lot tools, morning light,
evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements, tools measuring sleep
duration quality. covering lot themes. like think now
armed number tools information. Things like knowing
temperature minimum is, knowing might wanna view light not,
might wanna eat take hot showers, God forbid cold shower, something
people including less loath,

1:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

can certain benefits. will allow shape sleep life get
consistent, less consistent amount sleep regular basis. Nobody's
perfect. fact little joke sometimes tell, not funny. Like,
jokes tell told not funny, but, know, much excitement now
intermittent fasting. Sometimes think someone start something
intermittent sleep deprivation, although already that. experiencing
lack sleep time time. don't think catastrophize much.
think wanna rather accumulate sleep anxiety to... know,
get bad night's sleep, want adjust, want get back track just get
consistent amount sleep. Use non sleep deep rest protocols help us relax
feeling anxious, trouble waking middle night.
lot tools there, zero cost. hope
find beneficial. hearing Costello snoring throughout episode.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better

keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.
thing said, one point said, "Typical temperature 96.8 actually
meant say 98.6." dyslexic slip part apologize. don't know
dyslexic. know haven't clinically diagnosed dyslexia, swapped

moment just say temperature varies lot across day night, theme
previous podcasts. can't really talk average temperature anyway,
want clear

1:17:25 Closing Remarks

50:30 Note Hormones

Sarah studies among things menopause brain. saying
lot emotional effects menopause, actually not directly related
hormones. There've really nice studies showing disruptions
temperature regulation menopause mapped changes sleep regulation
impact emotionality inability correctly adjust circuits related emotionality.
encourage look work. probably guest
podcast point future, 'cause knowledgeable sorts
issues, well issues related testosterone people sorts different
chromosomal backgrounds. sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation energy. not
just deprivation immune function. deprivation self-induced therapy every time
go sleep. Okay. things like EMDR ketamine therapies in-clinic
therapies, REM sleep one giving every night go
sleep. raises, think, important question is, get
know getting

51:40 Measuring REM / SWS

appropriate amount REM sleep slow wave sleep. talk
next. one go getting appropriate amount slow-wave
sleep REM sleep knowing getting right amount. Well, short
hooking EEG, gonna tough get exact measurements brain
states night night. people nowadays using things like, Oura Ring
WHOOP band, device measure quality depth duration
sleep. many people devices can quite useful. people
gauging sleep way whether not feel rested, whether not
feel like learning getting better not. things one
can really do. first one might surprise light everything said,
probably everything heard sleep. study done Harvard
undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, Robert Stickgold's lab time.
study explored variations total sleep time related learning,
compared total sleep time itself. summarize study, found


important regular amount sleep night opposed
total duration.

53:15 Sleep Consistency

words, showed improvements learning deficits
learning related whether not got six hours, six hours, five hours, six
hours, better somebody got instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven
hours, four five hours. See might say, "Well, crazy thought
just supposed get sleep REM towards morning."
turns forsake learning new information performance exams
particular, measured, limiting variation amount sleep
least important perhaps important just getting sleep overall.
think will bring people great relief, many people great relief struggling
"get enough sleep." Remember, episodes ago talked difference
fatigue insomnia. know, fatigue tends tired.
Insomnia tends lead sleepiness day falling asleep.
don't want that, don't want either things really. But, found striking
data study really point fact consistently getting
amount sleep better just getting sleep. think nowadays many
people just aiming sleep, rather troubled fact
getting five hours, getting six hours cases. may
case sleep deprived need sleep, people just
lower sleep need. find great relief, personally, fact consistently
getting, me, six hours six half hours going beneficial
constantly striving eight nine finding nights getting five
sometimes getting nine varying around mean. recall, think
gonna get precisely right, not know least close. every hour
variation sleep regardless whether not sleep one typically got,
17% reduction performance particular exam type.

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can
help support Huberman Lab Podcast greatly appreciate question.
can help support podcast subscribing YouTube channel, haven't
already leaving comments questions comment section.
subscribe Apple Spotify, helpful. place Apple Podcasts
leave rating, well comments feel podcast.
suggest podcast friends coworkers anyone else think
benefit information also really helps us get word out.
course, check sponsors direct way help us continue
get information general public. Many asked
supplements personally get supplements. partnered Thorne
get supplements Thorne because, view highest level
stringency precision terms bottle. also high
quality standards. partnered Mayo Clinic major sports
organizations. wanna try Thorne supplements can go thorne.com.
Thorne spelled thorne.com/u/huberman. can see formulations
take. also get 20% off, not just formulations, anything
Thorne makes. thorne.com/u/huberman

1:15:50 Corrections

get 20% off anything provide. Last not least, people wrote
questions/corrections things said previous podcasts.
keeping goal making information accurate clear, just want correct


things said. One guessing probably came
endocrinologist somebody else knows lot testicles said,
"Huberman, mentioned testosterone made sertoli cells testes,
not. made leydig cells testes." indeed correct.
want make sure clarify that. Testosterone made leydig cells
testes, not sertoli cells. sertoli cells make 5 alpha-reductase aromatase,
enzymes involved conversion testosterone things like DHT
estrogen. thank correction. genuinely appreciate it. misspoke.
thing said, one point said, "Typical temperature 96.8 actually
meant say 98.6." dyslexic slip part apologize. don't know
dyslexic. know haven't clinically diagnosed dyslexia, swapped
them, sometimes happens going fast. apologize. use
moment just say temperature varies lot across day night, theme
previous podcasts. can't really talk average temperature anyway,
want clear

1:17:25 Closing Remarks

people think average temperature 98.6. misspoke, error
apologize. Thank joining journey nervous system biology
trying understand mechanisms make us function
sleep wakefulness. really incredible landscape consider hope
getting lot information. always thank interest
science.


REM sleep. brings us to, get REM sleep. Well,
couple different ways

56:00 Bed Wetting

not get REM sleep. right. First all, drink lot fluid right
going sleep. One reasons wake middle night use
bathroom bladder full neural connection, literally set
neurons nerve circuit goes brain stem wakes us up. Actually
people know won't mentioned, actually use try adjust
jet lag trying stay awake. urinate one
anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. really go bathroom
hard fall asleep stay asleep. bedwetting, happens kids
early failure circuits mature until, know, think assume
babies gonna pee sleep, adults aren't supposed that.
circuits take time develop kids develop little bit later
others. full bladder one way disrupt sleep. don't wanna go
bed dehydrated, one way. hand evidence want
remember dreams more, remember dreams tool
can use. don't necessarily recommend it, drink bunch water
go sleep. happens tend break REM sleep.
tends fractured. sleep journal done laboratory
studies. Believe not, people will recall dreams
kind semi-conscious state constantly waking throughout night.
suggest not full bladder go sleep. one's kind obvious
one, nonetheless. one recall REM sleep
shift neurotransmitter less serotonin, right? Just wanna make sure
got right. Excuse me, less serotonin. lot supplements

58:00 Serotonin

geared toward improving sleep. taken taken many them,
not point. report back you. think mentioned
previous episode take tryptophan, anything contains 5-HTP,


serotonin precursor serotonin, serotonin made tryptophan, tend fall
deeply asleep wake hours later. makes sense now
based fact that, just don't want lot REM sleep early on.
probably happening getting lot REM sleep early on, low levels
serotonin typically associated slow wave sleep comes early
night. people supplements might work, aware serotonin
supplements disrupt timing REM sleep slow wave sleep.
case led waking shortly going sleep not able get back
sleep. Now want increase slow wave sleep. interesting.
ways that.

59:00 Increasing SWS

One powerful ways increase slow wave sleep, percentage slow
wave sleep, apparently without disruption components sleep
learning engage resistance exercise. pretty clear resistance exercise
triggers number metabolic endocrine pathways lend release
growth hormone, happens early night. resistance exercise therefore
can induce greater percentage slow wave sleep. doesn't done
close going bed time. fact, people exercise disruptive,
reasons talked previous episodes. resistance exercise, unlike aerobic
exercise seem increase amount slow wave sleep, know
involved motor learning acquisition

1:11:40 New Topic

about. close segment sleep moving
new theme topic next four five episodes. going discuss
science tools related neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity remarkable feature
nervous system. fact, defining feature nervous system,
ability change response experience. unlike every tissue
collection cells organ body. really makes us us species
makes us us individuals, really potential lies. Everything
know, everything can do, true potential terms will ever
able know, do, say, life set limits neuroplasticity. going
explore learning childhood, learning adulthood. going discuss detailed
protocols relate sensory plasticity. Learning new sensory information, versus
motor plasticity sensory motor integration. going talk language
acquisition. going talking emotional acquisition breadth. well
as, think topic lot people gonna find fascinating is, relationship
plasticity set childhood attachment parent caregiver,
maps onto adult relationships. Many probably heard secure attach
insecure attach. A, B C, D babies called classic studies
Bowlby others. now actual neuroscience can say circuits
active early life attachment map adult attachment styles,
challenges, makes us likely select certain partners styles


attachment, well change those. really fascinating think
neuroscience's time come neuroplasticity. also gonna talk, course,
supplements chemicals machines devices can assist
speeding plasticity process. believe not, cases
might want delay plasticity order get depth learning
learning last longer. Something just absolutely spectacular literature.
excited move topic soon. hope tools acquired far
knowledge acquired far helping self evaluation
experimentation see fit, allowing not just sleep better, feel
better awake. hopefully set stage learn better
start march month neuroplasticity. Many asked can
