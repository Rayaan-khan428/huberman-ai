00:04:58 Deliberate Unlearning

really appreciate interest helping us keep coming way. Thank you.
continue discussion neuroplasticity. incredible feature
nervous system allows change response experience, even
ways consciously deliberately decide change it. incredible
feature. No organ body capability. nervous system,
governs everything are, feel do,
capability. issue people don't know access neuroplasticity. Children
readily access neuroplasticity don't even realize it. Adults
want neuroplasticity entire month Huberman Lab Podcast
about. explored neuroplasticity variety different perspectives.
talked representational plasticity. talked importance focus
reward. talked amazing somewhat surprising aspect vestibular
system, altering relationship gravity, addition that, making errors
try learn, can open windows plasticity, not really talked
much directing plasticity toward particular outcomes, thus far, really
haven't talked yet undo things don't want. talked learning
say learn language, learn free throws, learn particular motor skill, et cetera,
call unlearning removing aspect
experience don't want? today, going explore aspect
neuroplasticity

00:06:43 Pain, Injury Regeneration

going context important somewhat sensitive
topic pain regeneration, cases, injury nervous system.
fortunate enough not concussion not
know someone experiencing chronic acute pain, encourage stay
us lot information going cover direct
relevance neuroplasticity purposes. We, always podcast,
going discuss science, get mechanism, also really get
principles. Principles far important one experiment one description


mechanism certainly far important one protocol principles
allow think nervous system work ways best serve
you. flexible batches information. going talk
principles neuroplasticity removing pain wound healing injury. going
talk acupuncture, things. going talk modern medicine's
attempt try restore youth aging injured demented brain,
going definitely talk tools. Got lot tools. consulted number fantastic
colleagues Stanford, Harvard Medical School, greater community
tissue rehabilitation, injury pain management preparation podcast.
want clear just remind not medical doctor. professor,
don't prescribe anything. profess things. beliefs, podcast
information purposes. hope tools discuss will benefit you,
always, talk doctor healthcare provider tools
plan add looking explore, well anything might look
remove daily protocols. words, don't change anything without
consulting expert first. responsible health, not me, say not
just protect also protect you. Please keep mind move forward
excited share information feel can
great benefit number people. start discussion pain sensation

00:09:17 System Touch (Somatosensation)

regeneration wound healing discussion important system
nervous system, somatosensory system. somatosensory system is,
name implies, involved understanding touch, physical feeling body,
simplest way think somatosensory system little sensors
sensors come form neurons, nerve cells, reside skin
deeper layers skin, indeed, do. correspond
to, say respond to, mechanical touch, pressure top hand
pinpoint, sensors, instance, respond heat, cold. respond
vibration. huge number different receptors skin take
information send wires call axons form electrical
signals spinal cord brain, within spinal cord brain,
centers interpret information, actually make sense


electrical signals, amazing none sensors different
unique form information uses. just sends electrical potentials nervous
system. nervous system, somehow decode given stimulus skin
is. Maybe wind blowing gently deflecting hairs arm
maybe sharp pinprick hot stove warmth glowing fire. arrives
nervous system form electrical things call action potentials,
just amazing, brain computes make sense them.
peripheral sensors got stations brain within spinal cord
make sense stuff coming in. Pain sensation pain is, believe
not, controversial word neuroscience field. People prefer use word
nociception. Nociceptors sensors skin detect particular types
stimuli. actually comes Latin word nocere means harm,
neuroscientists not want talk pain? Well, subjective.

00:11:42 Pain Injury Dissociable

mental component physical component. cannot say pain simply
attempt avoid physical harm body, why. actually can
dissociated one another. good example if, God forbid,
exposed high levels radiation, working sort material
radioactive near former radioactive plant radiation,
excessive X-rays, et cetera, wouldn't feel pain X-rays. fact,
don't. ever X-rays, have, don't feel anything. put
lead blanket, run behind wall they, case, take
pictures teeth really scary go, "Something really terrible
must happening here," don't feel anything, can lot tissue
damage. can mutations introduced cells, et cetera. X-rays, not
saying people shouldn't X-rays, excessive X-rays certainly not good
human beings, likewise excessive exposure radiation. can tissue
damage without physical perception mental perception pain all. well,
can belief pain feeling pain without tissue damage,
famous case published "British Journal Medicine"
construction worker, think fell story went, 14-inch nail went
boot boot excruciating pain just beyond anything


experienced. reported couldn't even move dimension, even tiny
bit, without feeling excruciating pain. brought clinic, hospital,
able cut away boot realized nail gone
two toes actually not impaled skin all. visual image nail going
boot gave feeling, legitimate feeling, experiencing
pain nail going foot, incredible speaks
power mind pain scenario also speaks power specificity.
not like thought foot fire. thought, saw nail going
foot, well, going boot, thought going
foot, sharp pain sort nail produce,
thousands kinds case reports there. not say pain
experience head, really speaks incredible capacity top-
down, higher-level cognitive functions interpreting experiencing
periphery, even just basis see, example radiation
speaks fact pain tissue damage dissociable one another.
talking pain month neuroplasticity? Well, turns
pain system offers us number different principles can leverage to, A, ensure
ever injured, able understand difference injury
pain difference, ever pain, can understand
difference injury pain, will able interpret pain,
course today's podcast, going cover protocols help eliminate pain
ends spectrum, periphery, level injury,

00:15:19 Objective versus Subjective Control Experience

top-down mental mechanisms. lot times podcast, fact
mostly, tend center physiology, really objective things can
describe talk about, diaphragmatic movement sunlight particular number
photons, et cetera, today's really exciting opportunity us discuss
subjective things. Believe not, going talk love. colleague
mine Stanford, runs major pain clinic, working published quality
peer-reviewed data role love modulating pain response,
twist not going reveal just yet, turns specific type
connection one romantic partner actually dictates whether not love


will alleviate physical pain effects really robust. amazing
literature,

00:16:15 Plasticity Perception

talking today plasticity perception, direct bearing
emotional pain direct bearing trauma things discussed
previous episodes little bit going explore even entire
month topics. get started thinking happens pain,
will describe examples

00:16:41 Lack Pain Self-Destructive; Excessive Pain

kind extreme cases. instance, will tell just now
mutation, genetic mutation particular sodium channel. sodium channel one
little holes neurons allows fire action potentials. important
function neuron. also important development certain neurons,
particular mutation, kids born without sodium channel
1.7, want look up. kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever,
terrible situation. burn themselves. tend rest limbs long.
don't make microadjustments. might see swiveling around chair,
moving around lot. microadjustments actually normal, healthy
microadjustments prevent us going pain. don't make
adjustments. don't get feedback particular position
never make adjustments joints get destroyed, essentially. don't
tend live long due accidents. really terrible unfortunate circumstance.
people mutation channel make much
channel feel much pain. fact, reasonable speculate one
reasons, not all, one reasons people might differ sensitivity pain
way genetic variation many sorts receptors express.
People make much receptor experience extreme pain even subtle
stimuli. good news good drug treatments can block specifically
sodium channel 1.7 people get lot relief taking drugs. Pain
much pain sensitive insensitive probably genetic


basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection
point fact balance right left side body
always dynamic. always updated level neural circuitry,
Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight
imbalances two sides body can get amplified,
situation one side injured brain injured representing one side
body, key thing really overwork side needs work

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,
great semblance ocular dominance plasticity, talked couple
episodes ago. won't go detail, Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel David Hubel showed one eye closed early
development, representation opposite eye brain completely
overtaken intact eye. important. means senses
movements competing space brain way think
principle anytime injured hobbling along, don't want injure
further, want try compensate ways respect
competition neural real estate, usually means not relying
still strong just going create runaway plasticity going
make hard recover motor function, cases, sensory
function, damaged limb. may wondering long often
one restrict activity intact healthy limb, limbs cases,
answer don't day, every day. experiments centered
one two hours dedicated work, sensory motor work or, instance,
sprained ankle left, might spend part day left leg,
provided not painful, can exercised, again, way not damaging
injury, right limb can't contribute exercise. might peddling
unilaterally stationary bike can that. different type limb injury, like
arm injury, might reaching, provided shoulder mobile, reaching.
might even writing damaged side intentionally not writing
preferred undamaged side. shown accelerate central plasticity
recovery function, think people want people


injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk

combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity

now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection

pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely

glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces

silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral

another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,

sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things

beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

00:09:17 System Touch (Somatosensation)

regeneration wound healing discussion important system
nervous system, somatosensory system. somatosensory system is,
name implies, involved understanding touch, physical feeling body,
simplest way think somatosensory system little sensors
sensors come form neurons, nerve cells, reside skin
deeper layers skin, indeed, do. correspond
to, say respond to, mechanical touch, pressure top hand
pinpoint, sensors, instance, respond heat, cold. respond
vibration. huge number different receptors skin take
information send wires call axons form electrical
signals spinal cord brain, within spinal cord brain,
centers interpret information, actually make sense


electrical signals, amazing none sensors different
unique form information uses. just sends electrical potentials nervous
system. nervous system, somehow decode given stimulus skin
is. Maybe wind blowing gently deflecting hairs arm
maybe sharp pinprick hot stove warmth glowing fire. arrives
nervous system form electrical things call action potentials,
just amazing, brain computes make sense them.
peripheral sensors got stations brain within spinal cord
make sense stuff coming in. Pain sensation pain is, believe
not, controversial word neuroscience field. People prefer use word
nociception. Nociceptors sensors skin detect particular types
stimuli. actually comes Latin word nocere means harm,
neuroscientists not want talk pain? Well, subjective.

00:11:42 Pain Injury Dissociable

mental component physical component. cannot say pain simply
attempt avoid physical harm body, why. actually can
dissociated one another. good example if, God forbid,
exposed high levels radiation, working sort material
radioactive near former radioactive plant radiation,
excessive X-rays, et cetera, wouldn't feel pain X-rays. fact,
don't. ever X-rays, have, don't feel anything. put
lead blanket, run behind wall they, case, take
pictures teeth really scary go, "Something really terrible
must happening here," don't feel anything, can lot tissue
damage. can mutations introduced cells, et cetera. X-rays, not
saying people shouldn't X-rays, excessive X-rays certainly not good
human beings, likewise excessive exposure radiation. can tissue
damage without physical perception mental perception pain all. well,
can belief pain feeling pain without tissue damage,
famous case published "British Journal Medicine"
construction worker, think fell story went, 14-inch nail went

ever injured, able understand difference injury
pain difference, ever pain, can understand
difference injury pain, will able interpret pain,
course today's podcast, going cover protocols help eliminate pain
ends spectrum, periphery, level injury,

00:15:19 Objective versus Subjective Control Experience

top-down mental mechanisms. lot times podcast, fact
mostly, tend center physiology, really objective things can
describe talk about, diaphragmatic movement sunlight particular number
photons, et cetera, today's really exciting opportunity us discuss
subjective things. Believe not, going talk love. colleague
mine Stanford, runs major pain clinic, working published quality
peer-reviewed data role love modulating pain response,
twist not going reveal just yet, turns specific type
connection one romantic partner actually dictates whether not love


will alleviate physical pain effects really robust. amazing
literature,

00:16:15 Plasticity Perception

talking today plasticity perception, direct bearing
emotional pain direct bearing trauma things discussed
previous episodes little bit going explore even entire
month topics. get started thinking happens pain,
will describe examples

00:16:41 Lack Pain Self-Destructive; Excessive Pain

kind extreme cases. instance, will tell just now
mutation, genetic mutation particular sodium channel. sodium channel one
little holes neurons allows fire action potentials. important
function neuron. also important development certain neurons,
particular mutation, kids born without sodium channel
1.7, want look up. kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever,
terrible situation. burn themselves. tend rest limbs long.
don't make microadjustments. might see swiveling around chair,
moving around lot. microadjustments actually normal, healthy
microadjustments prevent us going pain. don't make
adjustments. don't get feedback particular position
never make adjustments joints get destroyed, essentially. don't
tend live long due accidents. really terrible unfortunate circumstance.
people mutation channel make much
channel feel much pain. fact, reasonable speculate one
reasons, not all, one reasons people might differ sensitivity pain
way genetic variation many sorts receptors express.
People make much receptor experience extreme pain even subtle
stimuli. good news good drug treatments can block specifically
sodium channel 1.7 people get lot relief taking drugs. Pain
much pain sensitive insensitive probably genetic


basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated

errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,
great semblance ocular dominance plasticity, talked couple
episodes ago. won't go detail, Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel David Hubel showed one eye closed early

arm injury, might reaching, provided shoulder mobile, reaching.
might even writing damaged side intentionally not writing

recovery function, think people want people


injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,

that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.

gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation

now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild

ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,

going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate

evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.

soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion

episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance
acupuncture, inflammation stress. even talked little bit high-intensity

electrical signals, amazing none sensors different
unique form information uses. just sends electrical potentials nervous
system. nervous system, somehow decode given stimulus skin
is. Maybe wind blowing gently deflecting hairs arm
maybe sharp pinprick hot stove warmth glowing fire. arrives
nervous system form electrical things call action potentials,
just amazing, brain computes make sense them.
peripheral sensors got stations brain within spinal cord
make sense stuff coming in. Pain sensation pain is, believe
not, controversial word neuroscience field. People prefer use word
nociception. Nociceptors sensors skin detect particular types
stimuli. actually comes Latin word nocere means harm,
neuroscientists not want talk pain? Well, subjective.

00:11:42 Pain Injury Dissociable

mental component physical component. cannot say pain simply
attempt avoid physical harm body, why. actually can
dissociated one another. good example if, God forbid,
exposed high levels radiation, working sort material
radioactive near former radioactive plant radiation,
excessive X-rays, et cetera, wouldn't feel pain X-rays. fact,
don't. ever X-rays, have, don't feel anything. put
lead blanket, run behind wall they, case, take
pictures teeth really scary go, "Something really terrible
must happening here," don't feel anything, can lot tissue
damage. can mutations introduced cells, et cetera. X-rays, not
saying people shouldn't X-rays, excessive X-rays certainly not good
human beings, likewise excessive exposure radiation. can tissue
damage without physical perception mental perception pain all. well,
can belief pain feeling pain without tissue damage,
famous case published "British Journal Medicine"
construction worker, think fell story went, 14-inch nail went
boot boot excruciating pain just beyond anything


experienced. reported couldn't even move dimension, even tiny
bit, without feeling excruciating pain. brought clinic, hospital,
able cut away boot realized nail gone
two toes actually not impaled skin all. visual image nail going
boot gave feeling, legitimate feeling, experiencing
pain nail going foot, incredible speaks
power mind pain scenario also speaks power specificity.
not like thought foot fire. thought, saw nail going
foot, well, going boot, thought going
foot, sharp pain sort nail produce,
thousands kinds case reports there. not say pain
experience head, really speaks incredible capacity top-
down, higher-level cognitive functions interpreting experiencing
periphery, even just basis see, example radiation
speaks fact pain tissue damage dissociable one another.
talking pain month neuroplasticity? Well, turns
pain system offers us number different principles can leverage to, A, ensure
ever injured, able understand difference injury
pain difference, ever pain, can understand
difference injury pain, will able interpret pain,
course today's podcast, going cover protocols help eliminate pain
ends spectrum, periphery, level injury,

00:15:19 Objective versus Subjective Control Experience

top-down mental mechanisms. lot times podcast, fact
mostly, tend center physiology, really objective things can
describe talk about, diaphragmatic movement sunlight particular number
photons, et cetera, today's really exciting opportunity us discuss
subjective things. Believe not, going talk love. colleague
mine Stanford, runs major pain clinic, working published quality
peer-reviewed data role love modulating pain response,
twist not going reveal just yet, turns specific type
connection one romantic partner actually dictates whether not love


will alleviate physical pain effects really robust. amazing
literature,

00:16:15 Plasticity Perception

talking today plasticity perception, direct bearing
emotional pain direct bearing trauma things discussed
previous episodes little bit going explore even entire
month topics. get started thinking happens pain,
will describe examples

00:16:41 Lack Pain Self-Destructive; Excessive Pain

kind extreme cases. instance, will tell just now
mutation, genetic mutation particular sodium channel. sodium channel one
little holes neurons allows fire action potentials. important
function neuron. also important development certain neurons,
particular mutation, kids born without sodium channel
1.7, want look up. kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever,
terrible situation. burn themselves. tend rest limbs long.
don't make microadjustments. might see swiveling around chair,
moving around lot. microadjustments actually normal, healthy
microadjustments prevent us going pain. don't make
adjustments. don't get feedback particular position
never make adjustments joints get destroyed, essentially. don't
tend live long due accidents. really terrible unfortunate circumstance.
people mutation channel make much
channel feel much pain. fact, reasonable speculate one
reasons, not all, one reasons people might differ sensitivity pain
way genetic variation many sorts receptors express.
People make much receptor experience extreme pain even subtle
stimuli. good news good drug treatments can block specifically
sodium channel 1.7 people get lot relief taking drugs. Pain
much pain sensitive insensitive probably genetic


basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection

always dynamic. always updated level neural circuitry,
Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,
great semblance ocular dominance plasticity, talked couple
episodes ago. won't go detail, Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel David Hubel showed one eye closed early

injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent

distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.

thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

will alleviate physical pain effects really robust. amazing
literature,

00:16:15 Plasticity Perception

talking today plasticity perception, direct bearing
emotional pain direct bearing trauma things discussed
previous episodes little bit going explore even entire
month topics. get started thinking happens pain,
will describe examples

00:16:41 Lack Pain Self-Destructive; Excessive Pain

kind extreme cases. instance, will tell just now
mutation, genetic mutation particular sodium channel. sodium channel one
little holes neurons allows fire action potentials. important
function neuron. also important development certain neurons,
particular mutation, kids born without sodium channel
1.7, want look up. kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever,
terrible situation. burn themselves. tend rest limbs long.
don't make microadjustments. might see swiveling around chair,
moving around lot. microadjustments actually normal, healthy
microadjustments prevent us going pain. don't make
adjustments. don't get feedback particular position
never make adjustments joints get destroyed, essentially. don't
tend live long due accidents. really terrible unfortunate circumstance.
people mutation channel make much
channel feel much pain. fact, reasonable speculate one
reasons, not all, one reasons people might differ sensitivity pain
way genetic variation many sorts receptors express.
People make much receptor experience extreme pain even subtle
stimuli. good news good drug treatments can block specifically
sodium channel 1.7 people get lot relief taking drugs. Pain
much pain sensitive insensitive probably genetic


basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity

Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable

able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk

constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying

really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation

interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things

pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,

going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate

soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally

movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms

consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks

taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock

heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,

chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National

episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down

placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

will alleviate physical pain effects really robust. amazing
literature,

00:16:15 Plasticity Perception

talking today plasticity perception, direct bearing
emotional pain direct bearing trauma things discussed
previous episodes little bit going explore even entire
month topics. get started thinking happens pain,
will describe examples

00:16:41 Lack Pain Self-Destructive; Excessive Pain

kind extreme cases. instance, will tell just now
mutation, genetic mutation particular sodium channel. sodium channel one
little holes neurons allows fire action potentials. important
function neuron. also important development certain neurons,
particular mutation, kids born without sodium channel
1.7, want look up. kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever,
terrible situation. burn themselves. tend rest limbs long.
don't make microadjustments. might see swiveling around chair,
moving around lot. microadjustments actually normal, healthy
microadjustments prevent us going pain. don't make
adjustments. don't get feedback particular position
never make adjustments joints get destroyed, essentially. don't
tend live long due accidents. really terrible unfortunate circumstance.
people mutation channel make much
channel feel much pain. fact, reasonable speculate one
reasons, not all, one reasons people might differ sensitivity pain
way genetic variation many sorts receptors express.
People make much receptor experience extreme pain even subtle
stimuli. good news good drug treatments can block specifically
sodium channel 1.7 people get lot relief taking drugs. Pain
much pain sensitive insensitive probably genetic


basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable

think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs

Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,

injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like

referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything

effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely

start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent
tip forefinger neurons represent thumb hand
distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.
smooth. As, say image brain, stimulate finger,
forefinger, march stimulation across finger, across palm
nearby thumb, see neurons brain also make sort J
shape pattern activation. means so-called somatotopy,
connections brain neurons sent body synchronized


with, meaning cross-wire form synapses input
viscera, guts, diaphragm, stomach, spleen,
heart. internal organs sending information map brain body
surface, internal information, call interoception, ability look
inside imagine inside feel feeling inside. way think
accurately representation ourself representation internal
workings, viscera, guts, everything inside skin, surface skin,
external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance
acupuncture, inflammation stress. even talked little bit high-intensity
breathing, talked restricting limb movement get compensatory regrowth
pathways, say reactivation pathways injured damaged.
always, take whirlwind tour given topic, lay tools
go. Hopefully principles relate pain injury also neuroplasticity
general, today context somatosensory system, will use you.
don't wish injury you, hope take information mind
will think ever find situation ask
difference perception actual tissue damage? injury
pain, same? Well, no. control experience pain?
Absolutely. involve taking drugs certain therapeutics? No, not

basis, course, things can make sure
experience less pain, although pain adaptive role. talk
features built physically relates pain

00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus

can recover injury. First all, maps body surface
brain. called homunculus. rat, believe not, not making up,
called ratunculus. Costello, dog, snoring behind me, dogunculus.
get nomenclature called this,

00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained

basically representation body surface. representation scaled
way matches sensitivity, areas body sensitive lot
brain real estate devoted them. back enormous piece tissue
compared fingertip, back fewer receptors devoted
representation back brain actually pretty small, whereas
representation finger enormous. big brain area devoted given
body part directly related density receptors body part, not size
body part, draw homunculus Costello's
dogunculus, find certain areas, like lips, like fingertips, like
genitalia, like eyes area around face, huge
representation, whereas back, torso, areas body less
sensitive going smaller representations. It'd distorted map.
can actually know sensitive given body part much brain area
devoted called two-point discrimination. can experiment
want. think described twice before, basically
someone put, maybe take two pens put maybe six inches apart back
touch facing away ask many points touching
say two, move closer together, say three inches,
likely experience one point contact, whereas finger, play
game day long millimeter spacing, will know two
points opposed one pixels, density


receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection
point fact balance right left side body
always dynamic. always updated level neural circuitry,
Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight
imbalances two sides body can get amplified,

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk

stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation

interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation

now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild

pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked

going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress

exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance
acupuncture, inflammation stress. even talked little bit high-intensity

receptors. direct bearing pain says areas body
denser receptors going sensitive pain others,
receptors, tend blood vessels glia,
support cells, cells lend inflammation response really
important. Just rule thumb, areas body injured large
areas low sensitivity injury likely going experience less pain

00:21:30 Inflammation

literature shows will heal slowly don't many cells
around produce inflammation, might say, "Wait, thought inflammation
bad." Well, one things really want get across today inflammation not
bad. Inflammation control bad, inflammation wonderful. Inflammation
tissue repair response going talk subjective objective ways
modulate inflammation tissue injury, even just exercise
intense. map body surface. sensitive different ways. Now
know why. got neurobiology somatosensation 101 belt
now. didn't cover everything, touch details go
forward. thought might nice time just think relationship
periphery central maps way many probably heard
before,

00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain

will frame discussion little bit better, phantom limb pain.
probably familiar this, people arm leg finger
portion body amputated, not uncommon people feel
still limb appendage piece body intact, typically,
unfortunately, sensation limb not one limb nice relaxed
just there. sensation limb experiencing pain contorted
specific orientation around time injury. someone blunt force
hand end hand amputated, typically will continue
feel pain phantom hand, pretty wild,
representation hand still intact cortex, brain, trying


balance levels activity. Normally getting called proprioceptive feedback.
Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback
lot circuits start ramp levels activity become
conscious phantom limb. lab Stanford, UC San Diego
one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down
modulation, top-down modulation, ability use one's brain cognition senses
control pain body, something everyone, not just people missing limbs
chronic pain, can learn benefit way tap ability use
mind control perceptions happening body, not
mystical statement. not mind, guess, much brain control
perceptions body. Ramachandran do? Ramachandran people
missing limb put intact limb box mirrors
looked box moved intact limb, opposite limb,
reflection intact limb 'cause missing opposite limb, see
intact, move intact limb, visualize
eyes limb place absent limb, mirrors, moving
around feel immediate relief phantom pain, tell
direct hand toward orientation felt comfortable them.
exit mirror box, take hand out, feel
hand now relaxed normal position. get real time,
moments, remapping representation hand. Now, amazing.
kind thing us like able pain. stub
toe, break ankle, take hard fall bike chronic
pain. Wouldn't amazing able use mind trick, not trick
real, visual imagery, remap representation body surface
body is. something benefit anything
long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection
point fact balance right left side body
always dynamic. always updated level neural circuitry,
Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight
imbalances two sides body can get amplified,
situation one side injured brain injured representing one side
body, key thing really overwork side needs work

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,
great semblance ocular dominance plasticity, talked couple
episodes ago. won't go detail, Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel David Hubel showed one eye closed early
development, representation opposite eye brain completely
overtaken intact eye. important. means senses

principle anytime injured hobbling along, don't want injure
further, want try compensate ways respect
competition neural real estate, usually means not relying
still strong just going create runaway plasticity going
make hard recover motor function, cases, sensory

one restrict activity intact healthy limb, limbs cases,
answer don't day, every day. experiments centered
one two hours dedicated work, sensory motor work or, instance,
sprained ankle left, might spend part day left leg,
provided not painful, can exercised, again, way not damaging
injury, right limb can't contribute exercise. might peddling
unilaterally stationary bike can that. different type limb injury, like
arm injury, might reaching, provided shoulder mobile, reaching.
might even writing damaged side intentionally not writing
preferred undamaged side. shown accelerate central plasticity
recovery function, think people want people


injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent
tip forefinger neurons represent thumb hand
distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.
smooth. As, say image brain, stimulate finger,
forefinger, march stimulation across finger, across palm
nearby thumb, see neurons brain also make sort J

external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

Proprioception just knowledge limbs space. extremely
important aspect somatosensory system, no proprioceptive feedback

one colleagues guy, everyone just calls last name,
Ramachandran, famous understanding phantom limb phenomenon
developing simple

00:24:00 Top-down Relief Pain Vision

powerful solution speaks incredible capacity top-down

long enough, including live, going experience pain sort, this,


just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct

Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve

interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic

time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent
tip forefinger neurons represent thumb hand
distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.
smooth. As, say image brain, stimulate finger,
forefinger, march stimulation across finger, across palm
nearby thumb, see neurons brain also make sort J
shape pattern activation. means so-called somatotopy,

accurately representation ourself representation internal
workings, viscera, guts, everything inside skin, surface skin,
external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance

just want remind you, isn't just physical injuries pain, direct
relevance emotional pain well, which, course, talk about.
Ramachandran studies really profound said couple things. One,
plasticity can fast, can driven experience something, just
visual experience. people mirror box thing not look mirror box
didn't get remapping,

00:26:41 Deaf Hearing Sounds

required visual imagery coming in. also know, instance, cases like
people congenitally deaf, cochlear implant, simply way
putting, not simple, way putting device replaces cochlea,
device normally born ear little called hair
cells deflect according sound waves allow us hear. replacing
normal hearing apparatus deficient deaf people cochlear implant,
brain can make sense artificial ear, basically, not outside ear, not
pinna, inner ear, can start hear sounds. people really like
artificial cochlea. really benefit it. restores ability hear like
it. people don't. deaf people prefer not hear anything, can
disruptive them, might need better
engineering artificial cochleas, really speaks fact brain
adaptive device. will respond give it. not device fixed.
fact, essence brain, especially human brain, take sensory inputs
make sense those, meaning cognitive sense, interpret signals,
may come shock

00:28:10 Pain Mind & Body

no means trying insensitive, pain perceptual thing much
physical thing. belief system experiencing body
important relevance healing different types injury pain associated
injury. people's pursuit neuroplasticity, question comes every
people will say, "If just brush teeth opposite hand
couple nights row, will get neuroplasticity?" answer probably yes.


deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection
point fact balance right left side body
always dynamic. always updated level neural circuitry,
Ramachandran studies mirror box support too, even slight

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent
tip forefinger neurons represent thumb hand
distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.

external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular

thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged

mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces

basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although

deliberate action. focusing it. end goal. likely make
errors, like jamming lips gums first getting better it,
heard last episode, making errors really important 'cause errors
signal plasticity needs happen, get actions correct,
correct actions programmed in. not sure brushing one's teeth
opposite hand effective use incredible thing have,
plasticity. not going open plasticity many things. really
important you, whatever reason, maybe crowded bathroom
easier one side other, fine, kind hard imagine
highly adaptive behavior, unless, course, injured limb
missing limb, gets really exciting important studies
performed mostly '90s well 2000s, that, now,
really solid base data. really center mass around particular set
experiments

00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster Injury

point particular protocols overcome motor injury, may resonate
who've ever injured point couldn't walk well,
temporarily, hope, even longer. Think sprained ankle scenario broken
arm scenario. familiar stories people cast
getting cast off particular limb wasn't used casted
much smaller atrophied. atrophy, might surprised learn, not
muscles aren't used. nerves sending signals
muscles not active therefore muscles aren't contracting. Work done guy
named Timothy Schallert graduate students postdocs, Theresa Jones
others, '90s 2000s showed something really wonderful think can
benefit injury even simply want balance
imbalances motor activity, think us tend stronger one side
side. Usually right-handed person will stronger left arm, not
always, compensatory reasons. time can talk handwriting.
lefties likely will stronger right arm, although depends whether not
people hook righties, hook around write top, hook
lefties. sorts theories can talk about, right brain, left


brain, math proficiency, et cetera. event, Schallert colleagues showed
damage brain sensory motor pathways, number
different sensory motor pathways, damage limb, leg,
arm, hand, great benefit restricting use opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb hand part body.
dozen papers showing damage centrally brain
damage limb, unilateral damage, say, one side, thing not
cast damaged side, although need protect limb, course,
damage. broken arm, need cast arm need brace
arm, key thing restrict movement intact, uninjured, opposite
limb, that, forced movement injured limb
remarkably, connections two sides brain, corpus
callosum, huge fiber pathway links two sides brain, saw plasticity
sides brain. makes sense hear it. say injure left
ankle limping along using crutches. think, well, last thing
want injure opposite limb not use opposite limb. right ankle
perfectly fine, lean hard right limb take work
left limb, left ankle, actually setting situation going
runaway asymmetry central pathways nerve-to-muscle pathways
left side, suggested showed variety experiments
encouraging activity injured limb, provided done without
pain, importantly, not just exercising limb part body restricting
opposite healthy part body, speed recovery significantly faster.
Now, want repeat, don't want go injuring something further. probably
worst thing do, cases people damage
brain, limbs perfectly fine, motor signals aren't getting limbs,
case, limb fine, actually free use either limb much
want, case, don't want rely uninjured pathway much.
fact, want restrict uninjured pathway. find studies remarkable
followed molecular level, cellar level many times,
think physiotherapists rest involved sports
medicine physicians will say, "Well, course makes perfect
sense," oftentimes not happens. Oftentimes happens
resting limiting inflammation, et cetera, injured limb limbs


corresponding injured part brain, experiments collection

00:35:00 Don’t Compensate

restrict activity side doesn't need work healthy,
great semblance ocular dominance plasticity, talked couple
episodes ago. won't go detail, Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel David Hubel showed one eye closed early
development, representation opposite eye brain completely
overtaken intact eye. important. means senses

one restrict activity intact healthy limb, limbs cases,
answer don't day, every day. experiments centered
one two hours dedicated work, sensory motor work or, instance,
sprained ankle left, might spend part day left leg,
provided not painful, can exercised, again, way not damaging
injury, right limb can't contribute exercise. might peddling
unilaterally stationary bike can that. different type limb injury, like
arm injury, might reaching, provided shoulder mobile, reaching.
might even writing damaged side intentionally not writing
preferred undamaged side. shown accelerate central plasticity
recovery function, think people want people


injured. want get back previously want
able without pain. brings another topic, definitely related
neuroplasticity injury general one hear lot,
traumatic brain injury. Many injuries not just limb lack use
limb

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't
protect much lot blunt forces certainly not falls things
sort. Many people, order survive feed families, go back
work. clear regardless whether not skull break
regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting
needles electricity

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating

that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.

stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation

now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild

anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate

evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back

soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally

taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock

heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may

wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,

episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going
tough one athletes even recreational athletes swallow
want continue sport, not tell
shouldn't, simply way is. folks military
certain professions, construction place see lot TBI. not
always just football. lot construction workers dealing heavy objects
swinging around space. wear hardhat helmets, unfortunately don't

regardless TBI happened many times happened,

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense
intensity exercise. Zone 2 cardio 30 45 minutes 3 times week
seems improve rates clearance debris injury,
general, injury no, accelerate improve rates flow glymphatic
system. find really interesting think nowadays obsession
high-intensity interval training people trying pack much can
short workout, great brings people table haven't
exercising before, think really important know data exercise
relationship brain health speak 30 45 minutes call
low-level cardio. fast walking. jogging can
injury safely. cycling. not kind workout designed get
heart rate point improving fitness levels sort
massive rate taking huge jumps VO2 max anything like that.
exercise, know number people, especially people
communities lot TBI, now starting adopt this, 30 45
minutes 3 times week so, more, Zone 2 type cardio can
beneficial washout debris brain, really interesting outside
TBI know aging aging nonlinear process. not like
every year life brain gets little older. Sometimes follows like
step function get big jumps markers aging. guess
think jumps negative thing everybody. like
live longer healthier brain body, types exercise
referring now really brain longevity keeping brain
healthy physical fitness. no reason couldn't
also, provided, again, safe given brain state injury state, et
cetera, no reason couldn't also combine weight training
forms cardio. think really interesting

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent

thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down

placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making

isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell

wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old

make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens

abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance

00:37:34.. Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing

concussion head injury, want emphasize not neurologist.
many colleagues are. point, will whole month TBI
serious issue huge discussion, want talk little bit
known recovery concussion, important
implications just normal aging well offsetting cognitive decline
physical decline occurs normal aging. shouldn't think TBI just
football players just kids injury just person
car accident. want learn TBI understand TBI folks,
also going talk TBI relates general degradation brain function
certain resemblance TBI general brain aging. Typically
TBI, number different things happen huge range
things can create TBI. Neurologists emergency room physicians
going want know skull injured brain rattle around
skull? actually breach skull? physical object there?
many concussions person had? Everyone's situation TBI incredibly
different, constellation symptoms many people, not people
TBI, report headache, photophobia, lights become aversive, sleep
disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. huge range
course severity will vary, et cetera. previous episode, mentioned Kennard
Principle. Kennard Principle, named famous neurologist, named
famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said going get brain
injury, better get early life later life brain
much greater heightened capacity repairing early life later,
course, none us want TBI can't pick get TBI. can avoid
certain activities give TBI, really, comes TBI,
couple things agreed upon across board. first one is, much


possible want avoid second traumatic brain injury concussion. going

00:40:49 Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance

system repairs brain, adult brain, mainly centered around
lymphatic system call, brain, glymphatic system. brain wasn't
thought lymphatic system. wasn't thought circulating immune cells,
10 years ago sort rediscovered look literature
realize stuff around longer, glymphatic system. sort like
sewer system clears debris surrounds neurons, especially injured
neurons, glymphatic system active sleep. imaged
functional magnetic resonance imaging glymphatic system something
want active going clear away debris sits
neurons, cells surround connections neurons, called
glia, cells actively involved repairing connections neurons
damaged. glymphatic system important many people, not people
get TBI, told, "Get adequate rest, need sleep," kind twofold
advice. one hand, telling get sleep good things
happen sleep. also getting people not continue engage
activity full time really try hammer it. might say, "Well,
trouble sleeping, supposed get deep sleep?" activity
glymphatic system, wash debris, occurring slow-wave sleep.
Slow-wave sleep, mentioned previous episode, something happens
typically early part evening. Even falling, early


part night, rather, falling asleep waking three, four hours
later, important continue get sleep know slow-wave sleep
mainly packed toward early part night, hopefully will alleviate
anxiety 3:00 4:00 wake up, although really follow
protocols suggested physician's protocols order try get
regular, longer sleep seven, eight hours. Later, going talk eight-
hour mark prerequisite repair. glymphatic system shown
activated two ways.

00:43:05 Body Position & Angle Sleep

One sleeping one side, not back stomach, seems increase amount
wash out, wash through, say, glymphatic system. aren't ton
data this, data exist pretty solid. Again, sleeping one side
feet slightly elevated, well, shown increase rate clearance
debris way glymphatic system works
physical pressure fluid dynamic allow work efficiently one
sleeping side feet slightly elevated. means not falling asleep
chair watching TV. means, possible, not falling asleep one's back
one's stomach, sleeping one's side, can't that, don't really like sleep
side. sleep feet slightly elevated. put thin pillow ankles.
don't TBI, concussions before, right now feel fine,
find putting pillow ankles helps sleep much deeply
wake feeling much refreshed. thing shown improve
function glymphatic system, is, again, sake TBI well
everyone, even without brain injury,

00:44:30 Types Exercise Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health

certain form exercise, want very, clear here. will never
not suggesting people exercise way aggravates injury goes
physician's advice. Take physician's advice whether not
exercising much intensity. However,
interesting data, can provide link review this. shows


exercise guess people nowadays call Zone 2 cardio, low-level
cardio one talking somebody else. maintain
conversation, although don't talk somebody else. just gives sense

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat
sports martial arts knows incredible little punch hurts fight
incredible much hurts fight. molecule adrenaline, liberated
body, truly blunts experience pain. know stories people
walking miles stumped legs, people sorts things incredible feats


allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments

podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,

fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked

mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,

going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress

hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally

taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock

interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought

episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain

cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk
somatosensory system, ability feel stuff externally, exteroception, internally,
interoception, somatosensory system wired communicating
autonomic nervous system regulates levels alertness calmness.
that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means
areas body near one another, thumb forefinger,
instance, represented neurons nearby brain. might
say, "Well, duh," actually, didn't way. neurons represent
tip forefinger neurons represent thumb hand
distantly located therefore map body surface,
homunculus, really disordered, not way. ordered.
smooth. As, say image brain, stimulate finger,
forefinger, march stimulation across finger, across palm
nearby thumb, see neurons brain also make sort J
shape pattern activation. means so-called somatotopy,
connections brain neurons sent body synchronized


with, meaning cross-wire form synapses input
viscera, guts, diaphragm, stomach, spleen,
heart. internal organs sending information map brain body
surface, internal information, call interoception, ability look
inside imagine inside feel feeling inside. way think
accurately representation ourself representation internal
workings, viscera, guts, everything inside skin, surface skin,
external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know
this, case, can also say regardless whether not
experiencing pain, acute chronic, tell close anything
proof, science, rarely talk proof, talk evidence favor
hypothesis, close possible proof interpretation, subjective
interpretation sensory event immensely powerful dictating experience
event. couple examples. First all, anyone ever done combat

allowed move otherwise pain, afterward
experience extreme pain, event oftentimes not experiencing pain
pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly

pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral

somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely

dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting

start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like

that, going talk acupuncture done right now also
points relief called referred pain. takes us back homunculus.
start there. representation body surface brain.
representation call somatotopic, somatotopy just means

accurately representation ourself representation internal
workings, viscera, guts, everything inside skin, surface skin,
external world, seeing. three things always
combined interesting, complex seamless way. Acupuncture involves
taking needles, sometimes electricity heat well, stimulating particular
locations body maps stimulation developed
thousands years, mostly Asia, now practice done
many places throughout world, maps speak to, oh, well,
stimulate part body, get response, somebody
gastrointestinal issue, like guts moving quick, diarrhea,
stimulate area it'll slow gut motility down, gut motility slow,
constipated, stimulate someplace else accelerates it, hearing
stuff, sounds kind of, Westerner not thinking underlying
neural circuitry, sound kind wacky. really sounds like alternative even
really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep

don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean
injury bad cells. going things going improve
perfusion, like glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

01:26:10 Glymphatics Sleep

feet elevated, sleeping one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times week. Red
light, perhaps, going useful although sunlight might just good depending
talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

00:47:33 Ambulance Cells Brain

like know mechanism least hypothesized
mechanism, molecule called aquaporin-4. almost sounds like fourth


sequel movies something like that, aquaporin-4 molecule related
glial system. Glia the, means glue Latin, cells brain,
numerous cells brain, fact, ensheathe synapses, dynamic
cells. like little ambulant cells. microglia will run will gather debris
soak run injury. Aquaporin-4 mainly expressed
glial cell called astrocyte. Astro, looks like little star. Incredibly interesting cells
thing remember astrocytes bridge connection
neurons, synapse, connections them, vasculature, blood
system, glymphatic system. sit interface kind of, imagine
somebody emergency site, car crash site, directing everybody around
do. Get person stretcher, bandage up, call mother, et cetera,
et cetera, get road, put flares. astrocytes work
capacity well things directly. glymphatic system
glial astrocyte system system want chronically active throughout day
much possible, low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio, night, slow-
wave sleep, really glymphatic system kicks in. hopefully
actionable takeaway, provided can kind cardio safely, believe
everybody cares brain longevity, not just people
trying get TBI.

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation

profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going

excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting

start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting

really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense
weak, heat without heat, different parts body can modulate pain
inflammation, shown particularly exciting study stimulation
abdomen, anywhere midsection, weakly nothing. "Well, not
interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut
activating gut area. activates particular nerve pathway.
aficionados, splenic spinal sympathetic axis really want know,
pro-inflammatory conditions. However, conditions if,
instance, person dealing particular bacterial infection, can
beneficial, goes back much earlier discussion previous
podcast revisit again, stress response


designed combat infection. turns certain patterns stimulation
abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways
appropriate control experiments. done not kind subjective way.
also done measuring particular molecules, IL-6 cytokines things
related inflammation response, showed stimulation
the, particular, hind limbs low intensity led increases activity
vagal pathway. vagus nerve 10th cranial nerve serves rest
digest parasympathetic, words, calming response. means
now front edge research field that's, early days still,
discovering depending whether not stimulation intense mild
depending stimulation done body can get different
effects. points idea can't say acupuncture good acupuncture bad.
systematic understanding exactly effect
trying achieve underlying basis really relevant thing
adrenaline said before, fight, rare ever feel pain get
hit, experienced that, later hurts lot. turns stimulate
pathways activate, particular, adrenals, adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine epinephrine brain well, binds called
beta noradrenergic receptors. really getting weeds, beta
noradrenergic receptors activate spleen liberates cells combat infection
anti-inflammatory. short-term quick response. intense
stimulation abdomen areas can pro-inflammatory
ways trigger certain loops go back brain trigger anxiety
pathways place people state anxiety exacerbates pain. One
pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

want center particular sequence tools hopefully won't need,
presumably human active, will need point.
managing injury recovering healing fast least fast possible.
includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing

absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces

silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral

sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things

beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

going close there. talked lot tools today. talked lot
somatosensation, plasticity, pain, acupuncture, nuance

00:49:20 True Pain Control Belief Context

Now like return little bit subjective aspects pain modulation
think interesting actionable everyone know

effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going

excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type

start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really
take look going hood certain types treatments
useful think likely lead expanded number treatments
number different conditions. want talk terms acupuncture
incredible way acupuncture illuminates crosstalk

really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense

interesting," might say. Intense stimulation abdomen, however,
electroacupuncture strong effect increasing inflammation body,
important understand not just stimulating gut

pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous
system, system controls alertness calmness, thereby releases either
molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead

turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported
refuted telling here. first one
basic one, now lot information act on, terms
know tissue rehabilitation, brain body, know sleep essential,
agreed eight hours minimum bed per night critical.
interesting, however, doesn't eight hours sleep. acknowledged
time might challenging get sleep, especially one pain
mobility limited. forget often roll bed conditions
sleeping can impact injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, agree, eight hours
sleep ideal, not, least eight hours immobile speaks
power non-sleep deep rest protocols too. can't sleep, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, provided links before, going continue
provide links previous ones new ones coming soon, extremely
beneficial. non-negotiable terms getting foundation allowing
glymphatic clearance tissue clearance, et cetera. is, possible, unless
absolutely excruciating just can't it, 10-minute walk per day, course
don't want exacerbate injury,

01:17:55 Ice Not Always Nice (For Pain Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.

least 10-minute walk per day probably longer. gets interesting.
taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface
muscle, number stuff supposed flowing can slow
increase inflammation wrong way, can actually restrict movement
injury site, bad want macrophages cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, debris injury moving can
repair. surprising made ask, "Well, heat?"
Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things

beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

pain-blunting effects adrenaline. tell exactly
works minutes talk acupuncture, norepinephrine binding
particular receptors, adrenaline binding particular receptors actually shuts pain
pathways. People anticipate injection morphine immediately report feeling
loss pain. pain starts diminish know going get pain
relief powerful effect. probably saying placebo effect. Placebo
effects real. Placebo effects belief effects, called,
profound effect experience noxious stimuli like pain can also
profound effect positive stimuli things looking forward to. One study
think particularly interesting here, colleague Stanford, Sean
Mackey. neuroimaging study.

00:51:45 Romantic Love Pain

subjected people pain. case, heat pain. People specific
thresholds heat cannot tolerate heat, explored
extent looking image somebody, case, romantic partner
person loved, allow adjust pain response, turns does.
people looking image thinking person love, even
thing love, pet love, studies previous one Mackey
colleagues showed experience pain reduced. threshold
pain higher. tolerate pain reported not painful,
twist turns extent love will modulate pain
everything infatuated obsessed somebody object
love. People report thinking somebody, pet, many hours
day, kind obsessive nature, almost like people might call quote,
unquote, codependency. listening, just providing air quotes
'cause codependency kind clinical thing now although thrown around lot
time. sort like gaslighting. People talk gaslighting time now.
Gaslighting real thing people talked gaslighting many things
outside clinical description. people obsessed somebody,
kind obsessive love somebody's face, even person doesn't know them,


little weird, response, feeling love internally can blunt pain
experience significant degree. not small effects. not just love can
protect us pain. infatuation obsession can protect us pain, not
surprisingly, early relationship is, new relationship directly correlates
people's ability, showed, use love, internal representation love,
blunt pain response. partners many
years love much obsessed them, terrific.
pre-installed, well, suppose not pre-installed. work
relationships work, got installed mechanism blunting pain, again,
not minor effects. major effects going
top-down modulation talked about, not unlike mirror box experiments
phantom limb relieve phantom pain top-down modulation,
opposite example nail boot, visual image made
person think painful fact painful even though no tissue
damage. perceptual. pain system really subject perceptual
influences, remarkable because, really, think
somatosensory system, cognitive component, got peripheral
component, another component way sensation,
somatosensory system woven autonomic nervous system,

00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control Pain

going get next, want just raise idea reason
kind infatuation obsessive love can blunt pain response increase
one's threshold pain may do, say almost certainly do,
hasn't measured yet, dopamine release dopamine absolutely
molecule liberated brain body new kind obsession
infatuation. distinct kind love chemicals, will, don't even like
calling love chemicals. just feels weird. text, delete
line, chemicals associated warmth connection, serotonin
oxytocin, tend stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
dilates pupils, gets people really excited. can't stop thinking
somebody. text messages even exciting. write can't wait
text message come back, dot dot dot screen. text message


excruciating. don't respond two minutes people getting flipped out.
not support kind whatever, saying obsessive type
love, without question going associated dopamine pathway,
seem utility context reducing unpleasantness physical pain,
probably lot reducing unpleasantness lot life, like sitting
traffic, et cetera, talk pain, emotional pain physical pain
start become one same. closely intertwined lines
neurally become blurry. mean that? Well, love infatuation
can reduce pain, presumably release dopamine, well,
dopamine release blunt pain? chasing dopamine release way
treat chronic acute pain? exactly going talk now.
Independent love, going talk something quite different putting

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked

lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light

degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies

drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid

shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP

number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down

tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem

become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just

field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

01:35:44 Synthesis, Support & Resources

00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment

different parts body, so-called acupuncture. Something that, many people,
viewed kind alternative medicine, now excellent
laboratories exploring called electroacupuncture acupuncture. big
university centers. fact, source everything tell next Professor
Qiufu Ma Harvard Medical School papers. stand behind information
going provide today, extracted largely Ma lab's papers use
rigorous variable-isolating experiments address just something like
acupuncture work, think interested surprised learn
work, sometimes can exacerbate pain sometimes can relieve pain
discrete pathways can really say, "This neuron
connects neuron connects adrenals," can tie back
dopamine end chemicals neural circuits giving rise
perceptions, experiences, rather, things call pain, love, et
cetera. previous podcast episode, mentioned experience visiting
acupuncturist getting acupuncture. acupuncture didn't really much
me, wasn't specific reason. gifted somebody
wanted try it. not passing judgment acupuncture. fact, know number
people really derive tremendous benefit acupuncture pain


gastrointestinal issues. actually lot really good peer-reviewed studies
supporting use acupuncture for, particular, GI tract issues. recent years,
emphasis trying understand mechanism things like
acupuncture acupuncture itself, not support acupuncture try get
everybody acupuncture way try understand sorts
practices might actually benefit people experiencing pain changing
nervous system brain-body relationship general, actually, National
Institutes Health United States now entire subdivision, institute within
National Institutes Health, complementary health, institute
interested things like acupuncture variety practices that, think, 10, 15
years ago people probably thought really alternative maybe even
counterculture, least States, exciting. think people starting really

really stuff, look neural circuitry, neuroanatomy,
really starts make sense, Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School
excellent laboratory, exploring stimulation different types, intense

abdomen can actually liberate immune cells immune organs, like
spleen, counter infection release things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed stimulation feet hands can reduce inflammation, again,
done mechanistically. done blocking certain pathways

pathway stimulates norepinephrine blunts pain, one doesn't.

01:07:32 Vagus Activation Autonomic Control Pain

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce
inflammation, not trying throw ton facts you. say, "Well,
supposed information?" means real maps
body surface stimulated communicate autonomic nervous

molecules like norepinephrine dopamine, make us alert,
fight, blunt response pain reduce inflammation, yet
pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing

inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing

Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near

mean? supposed put together? Well,
paper published "Nature Medicine" 2014, excellent journal,
describes dopamine can activate vagus peripherally the, not dopamine


brain, peripherally, norepinephrine can activate vagus peripherally reduce

pathways stimulated pro-inflammatory, brings us
question

01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead DHT

inflammation stuff people talking about? One things
bothers much days, not easily irritated, really bothers
people talking inflammation like inflammation bad. Inflammation
terrific. Inflammation reason cells called site injury clear out.
Inflammation going allow heal injury. Chronic inflammation
bad, acute inflammation absolutely essential. Remember kids talked
earlier mutations receptors sensing pain? never get
inflammation joints literally disintegrate. really horrible
don't actually inflammation response never triggered
pain response. Inflammation can beneficial. lot interest
nowadays taking things things limit inflammation. One ones
comes lot turmeric. sure moment anyone starts talking inflammation
question is, "What turmeric?" talked turmeric elsewhere.
skeptical turmeric might lose friends, although that'd weird
friend, say something friendships lost friends
discussion turmeric, case, turmeric anti-inflammatory
properties, no question that, just described, inflammation can
good thing, least short term. thing turmeric
study published Stanford collection work
universities showing lot turmeric heavily contaminated lead. lead
used get really rich, dense, orange coloring everyone wants see,
check sources turmeric. thing is, men particular,


turmeric can antagonistic dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone
dominant form androgen human males involved things like
aggression libido things sort. Many people talked
taken turmeric get severe blunting affect libido. people
might serious negative. certainly avoid turmeric. don't like turmeric
reason. also think inflammation response healthy response.
keep check going talk specific practices wound healing
injury moment, idea just inflammation bad want reduce
inflammation across board, nothing truth.
pathways exist body specifically increase inflammation.
inflammation goes unchecked, just like stress, problematic repair,
brain injury, can exacerbate certain forms dementia, et cetera, like
create little bit nuance lot nuance, possible, conversation
around inflammation people just taken discussion around
inflammation idea just inflammation bad nothing
truth. continue, just thought answer question get lot
Wim Hof breathing?

01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing

get asked lot. Wim Hof, also called aka Iceman, breathing
similar Tummo breathing, originally called, involves basically
hyperventilating exhales breath holds. couple
things that. never done near water. People done near
water unfortunately drowned. certainly not everybody not
either promote discourage people it, think ask
ourselves, "What net effect that?" number people asked
relation pain management. effect kind breathing, not
mysterious effect. liberates adrenaline adrenals. paper published
"Proceedings National Academy Sciences," fine journal,
showing breathing pattern can counter infection endotoxin
adrenaline system spleen active,
response used counter infection stress counters infection. talk
going forward, idea stress lends infection false. Stress


counters infection liberating killer cells body. don't want stress
response stay indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
anything releases adrenaline will counter infection, want regulate
duration adrenaline response. make perfect sense. We, species,
evolve conditions famine cold. Actually, Texas right now
extreme case cold power outage. seen pictures lot people
really suffering. systems releasing ton adrenaline. cold.
likely hungry. probably stressed. releasing lot
adrenaline keeping safe infection. get heat back
relax can finally warm again, like
soon, hopefully time podcast comes out, will already happened,
typically people get sick immune response blunted
stress response starts subside. Stress, inflammation, countering infection, comes
endotoxin, comes number things. can cold. can
hyperventilation. can physical threat. can stress
exam upcoming surgery. adrenaline thing inflammation associated
adaptive. highly adaptive. short-term plasticity designed
make us better experiencing challenged with, not worse,
hopefully will add additional layer whole idea stress bad,
inflammation bad, et cetera. Again, not suggesting people don't
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing, just want point utility.
similar utility cold showers, ice baths forms anything
increase adrenaline. Every episode, want make sure every listener comes away
much knowledge possible also actionable tools, today talked
variety tools,

01:14:53 Protocols Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain

includes removing pain. includes getting mobility back getting back
normal life, whatever means you. want emphasize talk
next developed close consultation Kelly Starrett, many


probably heard before. Kelly can found Ready State. formally
trained, degreed educated, exercise physiologist. world expert
movement tissue rehabilitation, et cetera. not sponsors podcast. Kelly
friend colleague. somebody personally trust views tissue
rehabilitation injury think really grounded extremely well medicine,
physiology, real cutting edge new might not get terms
advice typical person. said, always, always, always
consult physician adopting protocols removing protocols.
asked Kelly, made really simple, said, "Okay, say sprain ankle
break arm injure knee ACL tear something like shoulder injury,
absolute necessary things regardless situation science
grounded in?" made point go find studies either supported

taught, learned injure yourself, supposed ice something.
supposed put ice it, didn't realize this, speaking exercise


physiologists physicians, said ice really placebo.
numbs environment injury, not surprising, will eliminate pain
short while, negative effects perhaps offset use. One,
sludges, creates sludging within blood lymphatic tissue, actually can
create clotting sludging tissue fluids, fascial interface

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
pain sludges tissue keeps cells need removed leaving
area. also interesting neuroscience know want kill neurons
silence neurons, cool them. well-known tool laboratory.
early important studies neuroscience formed basis
textbooks lowering cooling probe particular area brain peripheral
nerve order shut nerve, cooling will shut nerve,


another well-known fact neuroscience text books activity
nerve pathway neurons comes back, called homeostatic plasticity,
rebounds greater pain, higher level intensity, pain system
equate greater pain. Regardless neurons body,
stimulate neuron, active. cool it, becomes inactive neuron
heats back cooled, becomes hyperactive, makes really good
sense heat, provided not damaging levels heat,
beneficial wound healing reducing pain short long run
cold ice, find interesting. terms chronic pain, manuscripts
this, discussion Kelly others, point fact chronic pain
basically plasticity gone wrong. sort like PTSD emotional system

01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight

stress system, chronic pain going involve number different
protocols rewire brain centers peripheral centers associated
chronic pain. Certain things like fibromyalgia, instance, whole-body pain,
relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought
ice, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, things block prostaglandins,
things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen. things generally work blocking
things, called COX prostaglandin blockers things sort, things
pathway. sorts treatments reduce inflammation may not great
beginning want inflammation, may important limiting pain
people can functional all, things talked today really
anchored three principles. One inflammation response good one.
learning Qiufu Ma's lab's work acupuncture. immediate acute
inflammation response good. calls site injury things going clean

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really

concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem

become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells

great, sounds like something one want do, one needs

relate little inhibition. brain, excitation inhibition. come
different sources neurons. inhibition mainly GABA glycine
things like that. fibromyalgia, little central, within brain, modulation
pain responses people experience whole-body pain. case,
emerging therapies really interesting. friend works National
Institutes Health unfortunately suffers fibromyalgia asked
lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,
cases, use, talk moment, cases use
restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought

talk to, can talk probably length future


episode. number people will ask me, sure, stem cells

01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds Nots

don't want take time going hour-long discussion
stem cells. Stem cells exist us development. created stem
cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just
every domain life, seems. high-integrity folks. probably
saying, "Well, not injured. not athlete. don't want stem cell injections. don't
have," again, saying shouldn't get stem cell injections now. Please hold off
field learns safely,

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

cells, cells can become essentially anything. Later, cells get called
restricted lineage, skin cell, unless fancy molecular gymnastics
it, can't actually turn cell neuron. Yamanaka won Nobel Prize
finding Yamanaka factors give skin cell turn neuron,
not approved therapy time, many people ask platelet-
rich plasma, so-called PRP. take blood, enrich platelets, re-inject
back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid
tissue. claims PRP actually contains stem cells very, feeble,
look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use
words stem cells. actually illegal point, least far know.
end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see
papers. want know evidence, course, always folks
say, "I don't care scientists physicians FDA say. just want
this," stance, stance. not govern that,
think people informed, thinking tissue recovery injury,
able glean. Again, check Kelly coworkers
Ready State. phenomenal worked top people just

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,

lot question now actually exploring red light therapy.
Something talked various Instagram posts. Red light therapy typically
talked terms mitochondria data not terrific, least
not really published blue ribbon journals cases, except one study
aware Glen Jeffery's lab University College London showing red light
stimulation eyes people 40 older can offset effects macular
degeneration improving health photo receptors. People fibromyalgia,
whole-body pain, now starting use red light therapies. asked
Kelly others experts pain, "What thoughts red light
therapy things like fibromyalgia pain, especially red light local therapy?"
idea, don't think field progressed far enough now really place


firm conclusions on, idea red light therapy locally may effect,
systemic red light therapy, like wearing protection eyes,
cases, not treatment macular degeneration wearing protection
eyes getting bright red light therapy many ways may be, use Kelly's
words, "Approximating effects nature." like surrogate technologies
getting outside sunshine. sun, might not look red,
lot red wavelengths coming toward you. red light therapies may
utility, getting sunlight may actually much effect. course,
wounds part body can't expose, imagine
red light therapy might good. don't know, depending neighborhood
live in, may may not weird thing go outside expose body
sunlight. Probably number factors dictate whether not that'd weird not,
you, not me, seems that, movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,

restricting injury release increase perfusion
site may actually accelerate wound healing. might sound just
like common sense knowledge, me, least 45-year-old, always just thought

back people. deal. deserves entire episode. never
shown whether not injection actually creating effect.
something acupuncture literature suffered long time, sham
control, called, sham, don't mean sham, science say sham
control meaning everything exactly way would. acupuncture,
bring needle right skin, wouldn't actually poke
skin, instance. sham control. drug treatment, inject
drug person control, sham control,
bring injection over, might injection not injection 'cause
imagine injection effect. never really shown
whether not PRP effects separate injecting volume fluid

look literature talk anyone expert stem cell field, will tell
it's, number stem cells PRP infinitesimally small. fact, much
places inject PRP injuries not allowed advertise use

end last year guessing still now. Stem cells exciting
area technology. However, clinic Florida shut
couple years ago injecting stem cells harvested patients eye
macular degeneration. people suffering poor vision
shortly injecting stem cells eyes, went completely blind.
somebody skeptical stem cell treatment work there.


actually hard get United States reason. not approved. PRP
treatments complicated. marketing around shaky best. sure
number people will say PRP benefited tremendously
don't doubt that. Whether not placebo, today talked lot top-down
control, just variant word placebo, belief effects, whether not
placebo not, don't know. wasn't there. decide not
tell shouldn't something, think anything involving
stem cells, one cautious of. also cautious anyone
tells PRP injecting lot stem cells. evolving area really
needs lot work attention. major issue stem cells think
concerning stem cells cells want become lots different things, not
just tissue interested in. damage knee inject stem
cells knee, need molecularly restrict stem cells don't
become tumor cells. tumor collection stem cells. get something
horrible like glioblastoma brain, terrible thing have, glial cells
returned stemness, excessive stemness, started produce many
themselves, glioblastoma often deadly, not always. Injecting stem cells, sounds
great, sounds like something one want do, one needs
approach extreme caution, even blood stem cells
re-injecting. think technologies coming. way.
devotees PRP, tell experiences them. curious. want see

01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science



want talk end really interesting somewhat weird technology,
baby blood. colleague Stanford, name Tony Wyss-Coray,
2014 laboratory published study showing blood young rodents, mice
rats, transfused old, demented rodents, mice rats, made old,
demented rodents recover much memory seem much vital
energetic, better recall different spatial learning tasks. Tissue wound healing,
since shown, can improved older animals. pretty incredible.
went show several years later blood umbilical cords, not making
up, blood umbilical cords can basis biotech
company. Actually, one former postdocs now employee there.
isolated molecules young blood seems vitalize revitalize old brain
body, one molecules goes name TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2.
going? Well, don't know long going treatments
based blood transfusions. doubt blood transfusions
young people old people going used treatment dementia, although
might, weird seems. know transfusions sorts stuff, instance,
fecal transplants used treat obesity. gut microbiome thin people
being, not transfused, transplanted colons guts obese people
leading weight loss, sounds really wild not topic particularly enjoy
talking about, nonetheless, points importance gut microbiome
regulating things like blood sugar health relates obesity diabetes
sorts things. appear things, factors blood young
members given species lost time older members species.
not going give tool basis findings today. not going tell
consume fluid member species, species,
reason, think important mention science asking questions
factors within brain allow young brain recover
much better older brain injury, sorts things, events, et cetera,
factors older brain limiting, thinking identifying
factors going allow people restore cognitive function, physical function,
wound healing forth. really exciting area. mention not sensationalist
happening lot excitement
think clear young brain body blood different old
brain, body blood, goal science identify isolate factors


make so, people otherwise get dementia perhaps even
dementia will allowed recover. Again, not actionable item point, one
think about, perhaps not long, one think about.

Well, turns heat actually quite beneficial. lot people talk heat shock
proteins genetic pathways protein pathways can activated
heat. little data support idea heat shock proteins part wound
healing process, least terms sorts conventional heat one use
like hot water bottle hot bath hot compress. major effects seem
explained heat improving viscosity tissues clearance
perfusion fluid, blood, lymph fluids, injury area. really
interesting. didn't know this. thought, well, supposed ice something. said,
well, whenever see kid get injured soccer, never me, course, no,
course got injured soccer time time, give ice pack ice
pack removes pain. think consensus now, surprising me,
ice pack actually top-down modulation. think
something pain interesting studies actually showed
placebo effect ice pack, ice packs placebo, perhaps. interesting.
underline perhaps knows? Maybe people
going say totally crazy ice actually beneficial, seems like
heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, turns movement can
act bit analgesic, can actually reduce pain, whereas ice reduces
