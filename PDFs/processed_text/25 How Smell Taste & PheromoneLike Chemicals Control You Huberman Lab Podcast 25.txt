00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened

actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice

better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain

early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels

can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer

like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,

talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma

article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory

tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot

chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't

100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something

biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw

people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,

Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly

also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring

olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look

steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami

enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two

oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally

sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened

know this, smell taste. ever cold

actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly

better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will

can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels

neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,

dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed

eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale

might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,
downloadable, also provide link it. just think fascinating taste

think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing

throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain

Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,
downloadable, also provide link it. just think fascinating taste
receptors expressed tissues. mention expressed
tissues areas body well, including respiratory system,
richest aggregation concentration receptors umami sweet course
tongue, also gonads. think speak possible bridge
think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory

believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present

pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times

probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things

tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.

something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing

interested richer, deep connection things smell

sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,

early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels

neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants

dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed

part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma

article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,

tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put

role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,

underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type

sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular

want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve

cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw

people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly

also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know

steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort

you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,

people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets

scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club

bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

00:28:56 Sniffing Creates Alertness & Done Properly Can Help Focus & Learn
Better

smells, odors impact us. So, want talk act smelling,
not somebody interested smell, somebody
interested making brain work better, learning faster, remembering things,
next little segment turns smell, meaning
act smelling, not good bad smell, act smelling, sniffing,
inhalation powerfully impacts brain functions can learn
can't learn. Breathing generally consists two actions, inhaling exhaling,
option course nose mouth. talked
previous episodes fact great advantages nasal
breather, great disadvantages mouth breather.
excellent books data this, recent book "Breath" James Nestor,
excellent book describes positive effects nasal breathing
well breathing practices. also book "Jaws" colleagues,
Paul Ehrlich Sandra Kahn, foreword Jared Diamond introduction
Robert Sapolsky Stanford. So, book chockablock heavy hitter authors
describes nasal breather beneficial jaw structure, immune

effects way can acquire remember information. Noam Sobel's group
originally UC Berkeley Weizmann Institute published number
papers like discuss today. One them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation, published Nature Human Behavior,
excellent journal. Showed act inhaling [Andrew inhales deeply] couple
interesting powerful consequences. First all, inhale brain increases
arousal, level alertness attention increases inhale compared
exhale. Now, course every inhale, exhale, probably
double inhales size something, physiological size talked
before, double inhales [inhales twice] followed exhale [exhales],
something like that. speaking, going change cadence ratio
inhales exhales, typically inhale, exhale. inhale,

exhale, brain goes subtle, nonetheless significant dip level

knowledge? Well, imagine, think will beneficial people
focus nasal breathing kind focused work doesn't require

powerful modulator cognition ability learn. can imagine sorts
ways might apply tool. suggest play bit
hard time staying awake alert, hard time


remembering information, feel like kind attention deficit, nonclinical
course, nasal breathing help, extending making inhales intense
help. Now, isn't really chemical sensing per se,
gets interesting exciting. somebody doesn't good sense
smell, somebody simply wants get better

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not

major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing
every time eat. don't weirdo restaurant
like picking radish like jamming nostrils, please don't that.
don't necessarily smell everything, although nice sometimes smell food
eat eat it, long-term effects terms

pungent foods turns out, studies show doesn't
really stinky cheese, know, cheese shops walked like
just basically gag, can't handle it, just can't there, just overwhelms me.
people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal

not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually

one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,

00:21:16 SMELL: Sniffing, Piece Brain Nose, 3 Responses Smells

interpersonal communication using chemicals not something hear
often about, super interesting. So, talk smell smell
works. going make basic, going touch
core elements neurobiology. So, smell works. Smell starts sniffing.
Now, may come no surprise, no volatile chemicals can enter nose unless


inhale them. nose occluded, actively exhaling much
difficult smells enter nose, people cover nose
something smells bad. Now, way volatile odors come nose
interesting. nose mucosal lining, mucus designed trap things,
actually bring things get stuck there. base brain,
actually imagine wanted, touch roof mouth. So, right
roof mouth, two centimeters olfactory bulb. olfactory
bulb collection neurons neurons actually extend skull,
skull nose mucosal lining. So, means kind literal
sense neurons extend little dendrites axon-like things,
little processes call them, mucus, respond different
odorant compounds. Now, olfactory neurons also send branch deeper
brain split off three different paths. So, one path call innate
odor responses, hard wired aspects way smell
world day born will day
die. pathways neurons respond things like smoke,
can imagine highly adaptive function able detect burning
things burning things generally means lack safety impending threat
kind. calls action, indeed neurons project central area
brain called amygdala, often discussed terms fear, really fear
threat detection. compounds, chemicals environment
smell them, unless trained overcome firefighter
will naturally heightened level alertness, will sense threat,
sleep, even will wake up. right, good thing, kind emergency
system. also neurons nose respond odorants combinations
odorants evoke sense desire call appetitive behaviors, approach
behaviors, make want move toward something. So, smell
delicious cookie, dish really savory really like, wonderful
orange, say, "Mmm," feels delicious, smells delicious
innate pathway, pathways require no learning whatsoever. Now,
pathways nose,

00:24:40 Smells & Memory: Powerfully Associated



olfactory neurons brain involved learned associations odors.
Many people experience can remember smell
grandmother's home, grandmother's hands even, smell particular items
baking, stove particular environment. Typically, memories tend
kind nurturing sort feeling safe protected. one reasons
olfaction smell closely tied memory olfaction ancient
sense have, say chemical sensing among primitive
ancient senses have, probably almost certainly evolved vision
hearing. come world still learning
statistics life friendly not friendly, fun place
boring place be, takes long time learn. olfactory
system seems imprint, seems lay memories early create
powerful associations. think long enough hard enough many
can probably realize certain smells evoke memory
particular place, person, context. also pathways

00:26:40 Pheromone Effects: Spontaneous Miscarriage, Males & Timing Female
Puberty

humans little bit controversial whether not sits truly separate
standard olfactory system whether not system embedded there,
call accessory olfactory pathway. Accessory olfactory pathway
animals responsible true pheromone effects. will talk true
pheromone effects, example rodents primates, including
mandrills. ever seen mandrill, like big beak noses things,
may seen zoo, look haven't seen already, M-A-N-
D-R-I-L-S mandrills, strong pheromone effects. include things
like take pregnant female rodent mandrill, take away father


created fetuses fetus, introduce scent urine fur
novel male, will spontaneously abort miscarry fetuses, powerful
effect. humans, still controversial whether not anything like can happen,
powerful pheromonal effect animals. Another example pheromone
effect called Vandenbergh effect named person discovered
effect, take female given species not entered puberty,
expose scent urine sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal
male, spontaneously goes puberty earlier. So, something scent
triggers something accessory olfactory system, true pheromonal
effect creates ovulation, right menstruation. rodents estrous cycle,
not menstrual cycle. So, not say exact things happen
humans. humans, mentioned earlier, chemical sensing
individuals may independent nose. will talk those,
basically three paths

00:28:56 Sniffing Creates Alertness & Done Properly Can Help Focus & Learn
Better

smells, odors impact us. So, want talk act smelling,
not somebody interested smell, somebody
interested making brain work better, learning faster, remembering things,
next little segment turns smell, meaning
act smelling, not good bad smell, act smelling, sniffing,
inhalation powerfully impacts brain functions can learn
can't learn. Breathing generally consists two actions, inhaling exhaling,
option course nose mouth. talked
previous episodes fact great advantages nasal
breather, great disadvantages mouth breather.
excellent books data this, recent book "Breath" James Nestor,
excellent book describes positive effects nasal breathing
well breathing practices. also book "Jaws" colleagues,
Paul Ehrlich Sandra Kahn, foreword Jared Diamond introduction
Robert Sapolsky Stanford. So, book chockablock heavy hitter authors
describes nasal breather beneficial jaw structure, immune


system function, et cetera Breathing nose, sniffing actually positive
effects way can acquire remember information. Noam Sobel's group
originally UC Berkeley Weizmann Institute published number
papers like discuss today. One them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation, published Nature Human Behavior,
excellent journal. Showed act inhaling [Andrew inhales deeply] couple
interesting powerful consequences. First all, inhale brain increases
arousal, level alertness attention increases inhale compared
exhale. Now, course every inhale, exhale, probably
double inhales size something, physiological size talked
before, double inhales [inhales twice] followed exhale [exhales],
something like that. speaking, going change cadence ratio
inhales exhales, typically inhale, exhale. inhale,
paper shows level alertness goes brain, makes sense
primitive primordial sense interact
environment bring chemicals system detect environment, inhaling
cue rest brain essentially pay attention happening, not just
odors name paper suggests, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation. means act inhaling wakes
brain, not perceiving smelling. indeed
sniffing action, inhaling action powerful effect ability
alert, ability attend, focus, ability remember information.
exhale, brain goes subtle, nonetheless significant dip level
arousal ability learn. So, mean? use
knowledge? Well, imagine, think will beneficial people
focus nasal breathing kind focused work doesn't require
speak, eat, ingest something. separate paper published journal
neuroscience showed indeed subjects, human subjects, restricted
breathing nose, learn better option breathing
mouth, combination nose mouth. significant
effects humans using modern techniques excellent groups. So, sniffing
powerful modulator cognition ability learn. can imagine sorts
ways might apply tool. suggest play bit
hard time staying awake alert, hard time


remembering information, feel like kind attention deficit, nonclinical
course, nasal breathing help, extending making inhales intense
help. Now, isn't really chemical sensing per se,
gets interesting exciting. somebody doesn't good sense
smell, somebody simply wants get better

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not


recommending necessarily, excellent peer reviewed data
showing indeed, use smelling salts, mostly sort include
ammonia, ammonia toxic scent, toxic way triggers innate
pathway, pathway nose amygdala, wakes brain body
major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing
every time eat. don't weirdo restaurant
like picking radish like jamming nostrils, please don't that.
don't necessarily smell everything, although nice sometimes smell food
eat eat it, long-term effects terms
ability distinguish discriminate different types odors. don't even
pungent foods turns out, studies show doesn't
really stinky cheese, know, cheese shops walked like
just basically gag, can't handle it, just can't there, just overwhelms me.
people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests
chemicals mouth. one ways can powerfully increase
relationship experience make much positive just
occasional practice 10 15 sniffs nothing, almost sounds ridiculous like
be? now, understand why, way sniffing
action increases alertness brain well increasing sensitivity
system. No system aware body amenable kinds
behavioral training shifts allow happen quickly. love able
tell just 10 15 near-far exercises pen going outside 10
15 seconds morning going completely change way see world.
actually isn't case, actually, requires training, little bit effort
visual system. olfactory system, smell system, taste
system just tiniest bit training attention, sniffing, inhaling can radically
change relationship food actually start feel different
consequence ingesting foods well becoming discerning
foods like ones don't like. going talk
really wonderful thing happens start developing sensitive
palate

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause

gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent

want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call

people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know

steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate

sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things

taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within

leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club

bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally

maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

Better

smells, odors impact us. So, want talk act smelling,
not somebody interested smell, somebody
interested making brain work better, learning faster, remembering things,
next little segment turns smell, meaning
act smelling, not good bad smell, act smelling, sniffing,
inhalation powerfully impacts brain functions can learn
can't learn. Breathing generally consists two actions, inhaling exhaling,
option course nose mouth. talked
previous episodes fact great advantages nasal
breather, great disadvantages mouth breather.
excellent books data this, recent book "Breath" James Nestor,
excellent book describes positive effects nasal breathing
well breathing practices. also book "Jaws" colleagues,
Paul Ehrlich Sandra Kahn, foreword Jared Diamond introduction
Robert Sapolsky Stanford. So, book chockablock heavy hitter authors
describes nasal breather beneficial jaw structure, immune


system function, et cetera Breathing nose, sniffing actually positive
effects way can acquire remember information. Noam Sobel's group
originally UC Berkeley Weizmann Institute published number
papers like discuss today. One them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation, published Nature Human Behavior,
excellent journal. Showed act inhaling [Andrew inhales deeply] couple
interesting powerful consequences. First all, inhale brain increases
arousal, level alertness attention increases inhale compared
exhale. Now, course every inhale, exhale, probably
double inhales size something, physiological size talked
before, double inhales [inhales twice] followed exhale [exhales],
something like that. speaking, going change cadence ratio
inhales exhales, typically inhale, exhale. inhale,
paper shows level alertness goes brain, makes sense
primitive primordial sense interact
environment bring chemicals system detect environment, inhaling
cue rest brain essentially pay attention happening, not just
odors name paper suggests, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation. means act inhaling wakes
brain, not perceiving smelling. indeed
sniffing action, inhaling action powerful effect ability
alert, ability attend, focus, ability remember information.
exhale, brain goes subtle, nonetheless significant dip level
arousal ability learn. So, mean? use
knowledge? Well, imagine, think will beneficial people
focus nasal breathing kind focused work doesn't require
speak, eat, ingest something. separate paper published journal
neuroscience showed indeed subjects, human subjects, restricted
breathing nose, learn better option breathing
mouth, combination nose mouth. significant
effects humans using modern techniques excellent groups. So, sniffing
powerful modulator cognition ability learn. can imagine sorts
ways might apply tool. suggest play bit
hard time staying awake alert, hard time


remembering information, feel like kind attention deficit, nonclinical
course, nasal breathing help, extending making inhales intense
help. Now, isn't really chemical sensing per se,
gets interesting exciting. somebody doesn't good sense
smell, somebody simply wants get better

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not


recommending necessarily, excellent peer reviewed data
showing indeed, use smelling salts, mostly sort include
ammonia, ammonia toxic scent, toxic way triggers innate
pathway, pathway nose amygdala, wakes brain body
major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing
every time eat. don't weirdo restaurant
like picking radish like jamming nostrils, please don't that.
don't necessarily smell everything, although nice sometimes smell food
eat eat it, long-term effects terms
ability distinguish discriminate different types odors. don't even
pungent foods turns out, studies show doesn't
really stinky cheese, know, cheese shops walked like
just basically gag, can't handle it, just can't there, just overwhelms me.
people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests
chemicals mouth. one ways can powerfully increase
relationship experience make much positive just
occasional practice 10 15 sniffs nothing, almost sounds ridiculous like
be? now, understand why, way sniffing
action increases alertness brain well increasing sensitivity
system. No system aware body amenable kinds
behavioral training shifts allow happen quickly. love able
tell just 10 15 near-far exercises pen going outside 10
15 seconds morning going completely change way see world.
actually isn't case, actually, requires training, little bit effort
visual system. olfactory system, smell system, taste
system just tiniest bit training attention, sniffing, inhaling can radically
change relationship food actually start feel different
consequence ingesting foods well becoming discerning
foods like ones don't like. going talk
really wonderful thing happens start developing sensitive
palate

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified

flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look

steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals

probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort

you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,

people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets

scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club

always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,

important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent

anyone can will completely change perception food

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit

Now, ways

think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,

interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will

15 seconds morning going completely change way see world.
actually isn't case, actually, requires training, little bit effort
visual system. olfactory system, smell system, taste
system just tiniest bit training attention, sniffing, inhaling can radically
change relationship food actually start feel different
consequence ingesting foods well becoming discerning
foods like ones don't like. going talk
really wonderful thing happens start developing sensitive
palate

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,
downloadable, also provide link it. just think fascinating taste
receptors expressed tissues. mention expressed
tissues areas body well, including respiratory system,
richest aggregation concentration receptors umami sweet course
tongue, also gonads. think speak possible bridge
think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within

McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

00:28:56 Sniffing Creates Alertness & Done Properly Can Help Focus & Learn
Better

smells, odors impact us. So, want talk act smelling,
not somebody interested smell, somebody
interested making brain work better, learning faster, remembering things,
next little segment turns smell, meaning
act smelling, not good bad smell, act smelling, sniffing,
inhalation powerfully impacts brain functions can learn
can't learn. Breathing generally consists two actions, inhaling exhaling,
option course nose mouth. talked
previous episodes fact great advantages nasal
breather, great disadvantages mouth breather.
excellent books data this, recent book "Breath" James Nestor,
excellent book describes positive effects nasal breathing
well breathing practices. also book "Jaws" colleagues,
Paul Ehrlich Sandra Kahn, foreword Jared Diamond introduction

originally UC Berkeley Weizmann Institute published number
papers like discuss today. One them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation, published Nature Human Behavior,
excellent journal. Showed act inhaling [Andrew inhales deeply] couple
interesting powerful consequences. First all, inhale brain increases
arousal, level alertness attention increases inhale compared
exhale. Now, course every inhale, exhale, probably
double inhales size something, physiological size talked
before, double inhales [inhales twice] followed exhale [exhales],
something like that. speaking, going change cadence ratio
inhales exhales, typically inhale, exhale. inhale,

brain, not perceiving smelling. indeed
sniffing action, inhaling action powerful effect ability
alert, ability attend, focus, ability remember information.
exhale, brain goes subtle, nonetheless significant dip level

knowledge? Well, imagine, think will beneficial people
focus nasal breathing kind focused work doesn't require
speak, eat, ingest something. separate paper published journal
neuroscience showed indeed subjects, human subjects, restricted
breathing nose, learn better option breathing
mouth, combination nose mouth. significant

powerful modulator cognition ability learn. can imagine sorts
ways might apply tool. suggest play bit
hard time staying awake alert, hard time


remembering information, feel like kind attention deficit, nonclinical
course, nasal breathing help, extending making inhales intense
help. Now, isn't really chemical sensing per se,
gets interesting exciting. somebody doesn't good sense
smell, somebody simply wants get better

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not


recommending necessarily, excellent peer reviewed data
showing indeed, use smelling salts, mostly sort include
ammonia, ammonia toxic scent, toxic way triggers innate
pathway, pathway nose amygdala, wakes brain body
major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection

looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source

Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically

neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.

ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn

people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look

taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating

interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response

oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually

eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

system function, et cetera Breathing nose, sniffing actually positive
effects way can acquire remember information. Noam Sobel's group
originally UC Berkeley Weizmann Institute published number
papers like discuss today. One them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation, published Nature Human Behavior,
excellent journal. Showed act inhaling [Andrew inhales deeply] couple
interesting powerful consequences. First all, inhale brain increases
arousal, level alertness attention increases inhale compared
exhale. Now, course every inhale, exhale, probably
double inhales size something, physiological size talked
before, double inhales [inhales twice] followed exhale [exhales],
something like that. speaking, going change cadence ratio
inhales exhales, typically inhale, exhale. inhale,
paper shows level alertness goes brain, makes sense
primitive primordial sense interact
environment bring chemicals system detect environment, inhaling
cue rest brain essentially pay attention happening, not just
odors name paper suggests, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked Inhalation. means act inhaling wakes
brain, not perceiving smelling. indeed
sniffing action, inhaling action powerful effect ability
alert, ability attend, focus, ability remember information.
exhale, brain goes subtle, nonetheless significant dip level
arousal ability learn. So, mean? use
knowledge? Well, imagine, think will beneficial people
focus nasal breathing kind focused work doesn't require
speak, eat, ingest something. separate paper published journal
neuroscience showed indeed subjects, human subjects, restricted
breathing nose, learn better option breathing
mouth, combination nose mouth. significant
effects humans using modern techniques excellent groups. So, sniffing
powerful modulator cognition ability learn. can imagine sorts
ways might apply tool. suggest play bit
hard time staying awake alert, hard time


remembering information, feel like kind attention deficit, nonclinical
course, nasal breathing help, extending making inhales intense
help. Now, isn't really chemical sensing per se,
gets interesting exciting. somebody doesn't good sense
smell, somebody simply wants get better

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not


recommending necessarily, excellent peer reviewed data
showing indeed, use smelling salts, mostly sort include
ammonia, ammonia toxic scent, toxic way triggers innate
pathway, pathway nose amygdala, wakes brain body
major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing
every time eat. don't weirdo restaurant
like picking radish like jamming nostrils, please don't that.
don't necessarily smell everything, although nice sometimes smell food
eat eat it, long-term effects terms
ability distinguish discriminate different types odors. don't even
pungent foods turns out, studies show doesn't
really stinky cheese, know, cheese shops walked like
just basically gag, can't handle it, just can't there, just overwhelms me.
people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests
chemicals mouth. one ways can powerfully increase
relationship experience make much positive just
occasional practice 10 15 sniffs nothing, almost sounds ridiculous like
be? now, understand why, way sniffing
action increases alertness brain well increasing sensitivity
system. No system aware body amenable kinds
behavioral training shifts allow happen quickly. love able
tell just 10 15 near-far exercises pen going outside 10
15 seconds morning going completely change way see world.
actually isn't case, actually, requires training, little bit effort
visual system. olfactory system, smell system, taste
system just tiniest bit training attention, sniffing, inhaling can radically
change relationship food actually start feel different
consequence ingesting foods well becoming discerning
foods like ones don't like. going talk
really wonderful thing happens start developing sensitive
palate

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons

sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste

bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,

sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club

something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women

two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

00:34:00 Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Ability Smell & Taste

smelling tasting things, can actually practice sniffing. know sounds
ridiculous, turns simply sniffing nothing. So, something like this.
[Andrew sniffs deeply] guess microphone sort smell [sniffs], guess
pen doesn't smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] turns series
inhales, course one followed exhale, 10 15 times
smelling object like orange another item food, even skin somebody
else will lead increase ability perceive odors. Now,
probably two reasons that. One reason brain systems detecting things
waking mere consequence inhaling. Okay, sort olfactory
equivalent opening eyes wider order see, less. Okay, last episode
talked opening eyes wider actually increases level alertness,
not just level alertness causes eyes open wider. Opening
eyes wider can actually increase level alertness. Well, turns breathing
deeply nose, wakes brain creates heightened
sensitivity neurons relate smell. close crossover, sure
know this, smell taste. ever cold
whatever reason lost sense smell, become call anosmic,
sense taste suffers also. talk little bit
minutes, first protocol, really like consider becoming nasal
breathers trying learn, trying listen, trying
wake brain way learn retain information, powerful tool.
Now, ways

00:35:50 Smelling Salts, Ammonia & Adrenaline

wake brain well. instance, use smelling salts. not


recommending necessarily, excellent peer reviewed data
showing indeed, use smelling salts, mostly sort include
ammonia, ammonia toxic scent, toxic way triggers innate
pathway, pathway nose amygdala, wakes brain body
major way. use smelling salts people pass out,
fighters used use maybe sometimes still use smelling salts order heighten
level alertness, powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. work
trigger fear kind overall arousal systems brain,
think people probably shouldn't use ammonia smelling salts try wake up,
really work. ever smelled smelling salts have, tried this,
give serious jolt, like six espresso infused bloodstream once,
wide awake immediately feel heightened sense kind desire
move release adrenaline body. Now, inhaling nose
nasal breathing not going that, going subtle version
waking system alerting brain overall.
interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly
increased. again, two reasons, one, brain position respond
better, brain aroused mere act sniffing, also neurons
respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing

people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests

are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.

earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

interested richer, deep connection things smell
taste, including individuals perhaps not just food, practicing enhancing
sense sniffing, ability sniff might sound like kind ridiculous protocol,
actually kind fun cool experiment can do. just simple
experiment taking instance orange, smell it, try gauge level
perception orange-ish smells, lemony, lemonish, lemony, don't know
lemonish lemony? Lemony smells, set away, 10 15 inhales [Andrew
inhales exhales] followed exhales course, just nose. [Andrew
breaths rapidly] not going 10 15. smell again, notice
perception smell, kind richness smell will significantly

respond lemon odor, lemony odor going respond better.

00:38:25 Can Become Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting
Better

So, can actually heightened experience something, course will
also true taste system. also can really train sense smell get


much, much better. Noam Sobel's group Berkeley happened
graduate student around time, every look outside
people crawling around grass goggles on, gloves on,
hoods earmuffs. looked ridiculous,
actually learning follow scent trails. So, world dogs sight
hounds use eyes order navigate find things, scent
towns use nose. scent hounds remarkable, can trained
detect scent. sniffing, know, bomb sniffing drug sniffing
dogs airports. now dogs actually can sniff COVID infections
high degree accuracy, can trained that. something
COVID similar infections body produces probably immune
response, odors dogs think high 90% cases, maybe
even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. theories dogs can sniff cancer,
stuff exceeds statistical significance. still little bit mysterious ways,
may not ever achieve olfactory capabilities scent hound, Noam
Sobel's lab people completely eliminate visual experience
wear dark glasses goggles, couldn't see, couldn't hear,
couldn't sense anything sense touch, thick gloves on.
masks just nasal passages open people fairly
short amount time learn follow chocolate scent trail ground, not
something people want do, showed using brain imaging, et
cetera subsequent studies human brain, can learn really enhance
sense smell become astute distinguishing whether not one
particular odor combinations odors less than,
different odor instance. Now, want this? Well, like eat
much do, one things can really enhance sense pleasure
experience ingesting food enhance sense smell. don't
great sense smell, sense smell really good
always picking bad odors, talk minute. Well, might want
tune sense smell practice 10 15 breaths, excuse me,
sniffs, not breaths, sniffs interacting food item thing
interested smelling of. So, ingredients cooking
with, really encourage try really smell them. sometimes hear
kind mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell food, really taste food.


always hear kind mindfulness presence thing, actually
can increase sensitivity olfactory taste system this.
long-term effects, interesting. isn't kind thing
every time eat. don't weirdo restaurant

don't necessarily smell everything, although nice sometimes smell food
eat eat it, long-term effects terms

people, love smell. So, tune interest experience,
think even fasters there, everybody eats point, everybody ingests

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use

poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn

people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet

least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,

Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,

hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women

two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,

think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually

something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent

somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even

interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

So, someone's sitting there, someone comes in, shake hands, person

00:43:45 Smell Readout Brain Health & Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense
Smell



sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized
controlled trial, published Journal Strength Conditioning Research
2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different
movements."

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within

putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize

trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory

believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

01:49:19 Recognizing Smell Romantic Partner

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

sensitive sense smell way allows guide eating smelling
decisions, maybe even interpersonal decisions spend time with,
mate with, whatever, way really line biology. fact, well
can smell taste things actually strong indication brain health.
Now, not say poor sense smell poor sense taste,
somehow brain damaged going dementia, although
sometimes early signs dementia loss neurons regions brain
related say Parkinson's can show first loss sense smell. Again, not
causal, certainly not case every time sudden loss smell
necessarily brain damage, want that, often
correlated. also lot interest right now loss sense smell one
early detection signs COVID-19 loss sense smell. So, just briefly
want talk loss sense smell regaining sense smell taste
powerful implications overall health. fact can indicate something
brain damage can even inform quickly might recovering
something like concussion. So, olfactory neurons, neurons nose
detect odors really unique among brain neurons get replenished
throughout life, don't just regenerate, get replenished. regeneration
something damaged regrows, neurons constantly turning
throughout lifespan, constantly replenished, dying off
replaced new ones. amazing aspect brain
basically unique neurons, one region brain
little bit maybe, olfactory neurons every three four weeks
die. die, replaced new ones come different region
brain, region called subventricular zone. name isn't important,
phenomenon, neurons born ventricle, area brain
hole contains... not empty hole, hole basically contains
cerebral spinal fluid. Well, little subventricular zone, little zone below,
sub ventricles. zone, exercising regularly, dopamine levels
high enough, little cells like stem cells. stem cells spit
called little neuroblasts, little neuroblasts migrate front
brain shimmy, kind move called rostral migratory
stream. kind shimmy along land back olfactory bulb, settle
extend little wires olfactory mucosa. ongoing process call


neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,
downloadable, also provide link it. just think fascinating taste
receptors expressed tissues. mention expressed
tissues areas body well, including respiratory system,
richest aggregation concentration receptors umami sweet course
tongue, also gonads. think speak possible bridge
think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,
effect tears suppressing areas brain involved sexual desire
testosterone males, concrete result, good result published
excellent group no pre-existing bias going in, just found.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

neurogenesis birth new neurons. Now, really interesting
neurons cortex, retina, cerebellum, not this,
not continually replenished throughout life. neurons, olfactory neurons
are, special. number things seem increase
amount olfactory neuron neurogenesis. evidence exercise, blood flow,
can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. Although, data fewer
comparison things like social interactions, actually interacting odorants
different kinds. So, somebody doesn't smell things well, poor
sense smell, olfactory system doesn't seem sensitive, sniffing,
smelling going good. molecule dopamine, neuromodulator,
associated motivation drive. cases, very, high
mania, very, low depression Parkinson's, people
dopamine essentially normal ranges dopamine also powerful trigger
establishment new neurons migration olfactory bulb
ability smell. Now, don't want confuse correlation causation,
not good smelling mean low dopamine? No, not necessarily.
low dopamine, mean poor sense smell? No, not
necessarily. people take antidepressants sort

00:48:30 Dopamine, Sense Smell, New Neurons & New Relationships

impact dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin will report sudden, meaning
within couple days, increase ability smell particular odors,
striking effect. people new relationship dopamine
hormones, testosterone estrogen associated novelty sorts
behaviors often associated new relationships three molecules;
dopamine, testosterone, estrogen kind work together. oftentimes people will
say report newly love new relationship just
obsessed with, just enjoy scent another person much
like borrow person's clothing sniff person's clothing
can even just absence person can imagine smell feel
biological response, something talk about. So, neurons turnover
throughout lifespan age, actually can lose sense smell.
likely, want underscore likely, loss sense smell age correlated


loss neurons retina, ears, loss vision, loss hearing,
loss smell, loss sense apparati neurons correlated aging. So,
talking today ability sense odors, like
empower tools will allow keep systems tuned up. Last
time, talked tuning keeping visual system tuned healthy
regardless age. Here, talking really enhancing olfactory abilities,
taste abilities well interacting lot odors, preferably positive odors,
sniffing more, inhaling more, almost sounds crazy, now understand why.
Even though might sound crazy

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,
bone, cribriform plate, sheers little wires off neurons die. Now,
eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put
down, 10 inhales so, smell again, et cetera. might also just take active
role trying taste smell food, taste smell various things. mean,
please don't ingest anything poisonous not supposed ingesting,
know mean, really tuning system, think excellent review,
going entire episode use visual system particular,
also olfactory system treatment traumatic brain injury, well
methods. wanted just mention number people asked
TBI. again, place senses ability sense
chemicals two holes front face, nostrils
powerful readout

00:53:33 Using Smell Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger

way control brain function nervous system function generally. Just quick
note use smelling salts, feeling may interested
application. interested that, recommend go
scientific literature first rather straight vendor call
days? Costello bro science, says, bro science, bro science. can go
paper, excellent real science, Acute Effects Ammonia
Inhalants Strength Power Performance Trained Men. randomized

2018, easy find. will provide link so-called PubMed ID,
string numbers, put caption want go straight
article, show significant call, words use
literally quotes, "psyching effect use ammonia inhalants


significant increase maximal force force development variety different

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces

similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory

believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go

Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

01:49:19 Recognizing Smell Romantic Partner

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

associate people sort of... us sort self-


conscious response like oh, want make sure shirt tucked prim

thing, actually people even person just met left room.
So, someone's sitting there, someone comes in, shake hands, person
inevitably subconsciously touches eyes. taking chemicals skin

00:50:20 Brain Injury Causes Loss Smell; Using Smell Gauge & Speed
Recovery

grounded real mechanistic biology brain wakes responds
chemicals. Now, speaking brain injury, olfactory dysfunction common theme
traumatic brain injury following reason, olfactory neurons mention
extend wires mucosa nose, also extend wire skull.
extend skull called cribriform plate, like
Swiss cheese type plate going through. get head hit,

eventually replaced, phenomenon concussion
severity concussion recovery head injury can actually gauged
part, part, not whole, part well fully one recovers sense
smell. So, somebody unfortunately suffered concussion, sense
smell one readout might evaluate whether not regaining
sensory performance. course, will others like balance,
cognition, sleep, et cetera. like refer really nice paper
entitled Olfactory Dysfunction Traumatic Brain Injury: Role Neurogenesis
first author Marin, M-A-R-I-N. paper published Current Allergy Asthma
Report, 2020. spent time paper, quite good, review
article, like reviews peer-reviewed reviews quality journals.
discuss just read briefly 'cause said better could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances common following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
can significant impact quality life. Although no standard


treatment patients loss smell." Now paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory
training shown promise beneficial effects. involves," go
tell us role dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, mentioned before,
mean? means head injury repeated head injuries
enhancing sense smell one way can create new neurons.
now, know enhance sense smell interacting things
odor closely, essentially inhaling more, focusing inhale
wake brain really focus nuance smells. So,
might instance smell test smell something like lemon, put

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can

taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste

different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start

know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat

general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship

give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love

unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,

taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami

poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells

not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually

one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

00:54:40 Smelling Dreams, Active Sniffing Sleep, Sniffing Sign
Consciousness

So, interested ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
might good reference. thing wanted talk reference
odors myth don't actually smell things dreams,
don't sense smell. pure fiction, don't know came that,
clear capable smelling things sleep. However,
REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, sleep predominates toward
second half night ability wake response odors diminished. not
absent, diminished. smoke comes room, will likely wake
concentration smoke high enough regardless stage sleep in,
REM sleep tend less likely smell, sniff. actually measured
number studies sniffing sleep possible. So, put odor like lemon
underneath someone's nostrils early portion night, will smell,
will later... will sniff, excuse me, whether not smell not, guess depends
showered last, will definitely sniff will report
later, especially wake soon that, dream percept
scent lemon instance. Later night, harder relationship
established, likely paralysis associated rapid eye
movement sleep, healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, don't want
act dreams REM sleep less active tendency sniff.
actually real clinical implications, ability sniff response
introduction odor actually one way clinicians assess whether not
somebody's brain so-called brain dead. not nice term, brain dead,
whether not capacity recover things like coma states
deep unconsciousness, guess call subconsciousness. So, will
happen someone injury essentially cold, production
sniffing reflex, sniffing response say lemon odor presented
nostrils considered sign brain capable waking up. Now, not
always case, one indication. just like use mechano sensation,


so, toe pinch instance, know, scraping bottom somebody's barefoot
see conscious, shining light eyes, things
seen movies television, maybe seen real life well. Well, odors
chemical sensing another way can assess whether not brain
capable arousal. actually olfactory stimulation

00:57:35 Mint Scents Create Alertness Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways

one prominent ones used various clinics. last point
specific odors compounds can increase arousal alertness,
simply sniffing not ingesting them. data, believe
not, good data peppermint smell peppermint, minty type
sense, whether like not will increase attention, can create
sort arousal response although not intensely dramatically ammonia
salts can instance. way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, actually
damage olfactory epithelium close ammonia. going
use smelling salts sure work someone know getting
using this. can damage olfactory pathway ways
pretty severe, can also damage vision. ever teared
inhaled something really noxious, not good thing, doesn't mean
necessarily cause damage, means irritated mucosal lining
possibly even surfaces eyes, please very, careful. Scents like
peppermint, like ammonia smelling salts, reason wake
trigger specific olfactory neurons communicate specific centers
brain, namely amygdala associated neurocircuitry pathways trigger
alertness sort cold shower ice bath, sudden surprise,
stressful text message evoke. Remember, systems body produce
arousal, alertness, attention, cue optimal learning, aka focus.
general mechanisms, involve basic molecules like adrenaline
epinephrin thing actually, adrenaline epinephrin. number stimuli,
whether peppermint ammonia, loud blast, number stimuli can
evoke adrenaline response wake response near infinite.
beauty nervous system, designed take variety different stimuli
placed categories, evoke different categories general


responses. Now, know lot olfaction

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing
away. think cringe like thing now, niece, whenever seem say something
something either eye-roll, cringe, combination. sour,
sweet, salty, bitter, umami system, not
wonderful pallet foods enjoy much, allow us that,
make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste
system. think system, taste system perhaps smell
system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper
published Molecular Human Reproduction. can find easily online,
downloadable, also provide link it. just think fascinating taste
receptors expressed tissues. mention expressed
tissues areas body well, including respiratory system,
richest aggregation concentration receptors umami sweet course
tongue, also gonads. think speak possible bridge
think sensory sensual experience food deeper
kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't
like include many names sake clarity, gustatory nerve
tongue goes nucleus solitary tract thalamus insular
cortex. don't remember names don't want to,
want mechanism, want neural circuits, circuit, gustatory nerve
tongue, nucleus solitary tract brainstem, thalamus, insular


cortex. insular cortex, regenerate cortex sort make sense
perceive various tastes. Now, amazing just taking little bit
sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw
up." know people low threshold quick gag reflex.
people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,
presence fatty acids essential, fact, no essential carbohydrate sugar.
Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly
individual, decide right you, everybody needs amino acids
survive, brain needs need fatty acids, especially build healthy brain
development, need amino acids fatty acids. sour receptor,
sour receptor? So, really like sour candies?
think gotten sour years. admit don't eat candy much,
particular weakness like really good really sour like gummy peach
gummy cherries dipped whatever sour powder, kid
admit it, liked LIK-M-AID thing, like drink powder. Please don't this,
don't give garbage kids, liked it, tasty, sour receptors not
can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches something like that,
not system evolved, know detect presence
spoiled fermented food. Fermented fruit sour element it, fermented
things certainly fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, things
sort can healthy us healthy reducing inflammation,
great data that, pro quality microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can
poisonous, right? Alcohols poisonous many forms system sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate area brainstem evokes
pucker response, closing eyes essentially shutting mouth, cringing

make sure bring certain things

01:13:48 6th Sense Taste: FAT Sensing



system don't ingest things. Now, sixth sense within
taste system? Not sixth sense generally, within taste system.
putative possible sixth receptor? already kind hinted talked fatty
acids, now data support idea although still work needs
done also receptors tongue sense fat.
fat vital function nervous system organs body
sensing fat content food, maybe can eat half, no less
half jar almond butter peanut butter one sitting. just can't, unless
not salted, case, makes no sense me. remarkable texture,
also flavor, texture fat. love butter, guilty, Costello
definitely guilty eating pats butter time time, no guilt this.
People eat pats cheese, shouldn't eat pat butter? think gross
maybe greater abundance fat receptors tongue, maybe
fat tongue do. nonetheless, ability sense fat mouth

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste

system well can trained can learn pick tones, will
different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system

push-pull exists, referring terms receptors

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things

one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

00:59:48 Protocol 2 Pleasant Putrid: Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro,
Asparagus, Musk

sense smell works, another experiment can do. ask
right now. like, hate, indifferent smell microwave
popcorn? people, including one member podcast staff says absolutely
disgusting them, feel like completely nauseating. don't mind all, fact,
kind like it. think smell microwave popcorn kind pleasant. don't
particularly like it, certainly not unpleasant. people gene makes
sensitive smell things like microwave popcorn smells like
vomit. probably don't gene find smell microwaved popcorn
pretty pleasant. people hate smell cilantro, people ingest asparagus,
urinate can smell asparagus pungent way, people
can't smell all. variants genes encode called olfactory
receptors. olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, one gene
codes receptor responds particular odor. don't gene
will not respond odor. So, reason people find smell
microwave popcorn noxious, putrid fact, gene
allows smell kind putrid odor within that. people lack gene
just simply can't smell it, not respect sensory
experience. one person finds delicious, another person might find disgusting.
give good example absolutely despise Gorgonzola blue cheese,
absolutely despise it, smells tastes like dirty moldy socks me. people love
it, crave it, actually, people get visceral response it, will talk
certain tastes can actually evoke deep biological responses, even hormonal
responses talk taste minutes. odors,
instance popcorn molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not proline pyrroline,
gives off people like toasted smell sugars kernels heat,
compound also found things like white bread jasmine rice, don't
pungent odor, people smell smells like cat urine. Now,
scents like musky scents musty scents secreted animals like skunks
animals so-called Mustelidae family. So, ferrets


animals can spray response fear, just want mark territory
want say mine. Dogs incidentally scent glands rub
things, cats too. musty odor, people find actually quite
pleasant,

01:03:00 Skunks, Costello, Quiet Western Front

people find noxious will depend course
concentration, right? never forget first time Costello got sprayed skunk
awful. actually don't mind smell skunk distance, actually little bit
pleasant, admit little bit pleasant me. don't think makes weird
ever read book "All Quiet Western Front" World War I,
description smell skunk distance mildly
pleasant, author book probably shared similar olfactory profile me,
rather, people find even tiniest bit smell skunk musk
noxious awful. Now, course high concentrations, really awful.
unfortunately, poor Costello, like literally red-eyed just snorting,
awful. joke dogs says dogs either get skunked one time
never 50 hundred times. Costello skunked no fewer, not
making up, skunked no fewer 103 times.
sees something hears something bushes, just goes straight in, not
learn. like this, musty scent musky scent, well says something
genes express olfactory neurons, completely inherited.
don't like scent, really noxious response
microwave popcorn, well, means different compliment, different
constellation will genes make olfactory sensory neurons

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get
activation umami tomatoes tomato sauces. tastes
taste receptors responsible for? talk sixth, maybe can
guess is, don't know can guess now. couldn't guess it, five
tastes one specific utility function. one particular group
neurons mouth, tongue, believe not, responds particular
chemicals particular chemical structures. total myth, complete fiction,
different parts tongue harbor different taste receptors. know, high school
textbook diagram know sweet one part tongue sour
another, bitters another, complete fiction, just total fiction related old
studies performed poorly controlled way, no serious biologists
certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection
wires, nerve bundles called gustatory nerve, goes tongue
so-called nucleus solitary tract. requested names, usually don't

sugar something sour like little bit lemon juice touching tongue within
100 milliseconds, right? Just 100 milliseconds, far less one second, can
immediately distinguish ah, sour, sweet, bitter, umami,

01:08:45 Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Sensing,
Fermentation

assessment made cortex. Now, different five
receptors encode for? Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, really
looking for? sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals presence energy,
sugars. trying told eat less sugar variety
reasons, ability sense whether not food rapid energy source
give rise glucose essential sweet receptors. salty receptors,
neurons trying sense whether not electrolytes given food drink.
Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically
active. also need potassium magnesium, ions allow
neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something
something kind gross, appropriate workplace, nonetheless gross,


biologists, say something say, "Stop, stop stop, going throw

people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,

Now, not huge proponent ketogenic diets them, think highly

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes

poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring

olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can

Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical

flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look

savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating

probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts

extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed

may able imagine foods delicious make entire

create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort

you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,

always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,

important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent

anyone can will completely change perception food

actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

01:04:32 TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Tongue, Gustatory Nerve,
NST, Cortex

receptors express. talk taste. Not whether not
taste don't taste, no way assess that, rather
taste things, meaning sense chemicals food drink.
essentially five, scientists now believe may six things taste alone


combination, sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, umami
taste. probably heard umami now, U-M-A-M-I. Umami actually
name particular receptor express tongue detects savory
tastes, kind thing braised meats. Sometimes people can even get

certainly no one works tastes contend way taste
receptors organized, completely intermixed along tongue.
heightened decreased sensitivity one five things mentioned; sweet, salty,
bitter, umami, sour one location tongue, likely reflects density
overall receptors something going brain, not differential distribution
receptors. So, sweet receptors neurons express receptor
respond sugars, way cones, photoreceptors, eye
respond short, medium, long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish,
reddish light. neuron, neurons plural, tongue respond
sugars. neurons, don't say sweet, don't actually send
sugar brain, send call volley, barrage action potentials
electrical signals off brain. amazing system. So, receptors
tongue make called neurons give rise nerve, collection

Electrolytes vitally important function nervous system,
entire body, sodium allows neurons fire. allows electrically

neurons active. salty receptors, reason make
sure getting enough, not much salt, don't want ingest things
far salty. Bitter receptors make sure don't ingest things
poisonous. know this? can say that? Even though definitely not
consulted design phase, can say that? Well, bitter receptors create
call labeled line, unique trajectory neurons brainstem control
[gags], gag reflex. taste something bitter automatically triggers
gag reflex. Now, people like bitter taste, actually liked taste bitter coffee,
children generally like sweet tastes bitter tastes, even babies taste
something bitter, just immediately spit up, like gag reflex. Putrid smells
will also evoke neurons, people sensitive,
sensitive low threshold vomit reflex, going somebody
lab early on. never intentionally, just laughing 'cause
dramatic. discussion, someone say something

people don't, people stable stomach, don't, know, rarely,
ever vomit. umami receptor isn't sensing savory body loves savory,
savory signal presence amino acids. talk
this, presence amino acids gut digestive system,

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste

different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,

can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural

know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet

least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food

enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.

sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much

anyone can will completely change perception food

rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn

savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals

probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat

you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means

interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes

body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn

steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami

enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say

you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis

activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track

Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear

sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons

interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,

opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.

hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women

two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization

recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet

least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan

scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really

So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind

can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,
effect tears suppressing areas brain involved sexual desire
testosterone males, concrete result, good result published
excellent group no pre-existing bias going in, just found.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

01:15:05 Gut-Brain: Mouth Extension Gut; Burned Mouth &
Regeneration

seems critical, can imagine is. want talk tongue
mouth extension digestive tract. know might not pleasant think
about, look lens provide, will completely
change way think gut brain stuff heard
recent years oh, second brain, neurons gut,
chuckling last years people gotten excited
gut brain, not excitement, think excitement wonderful,
always knew nervous system extended brain body,
people seem kind overwhelmed surprised idea neurons
gut can sense things like sugars fatty acids. think
beautiful discoveries, don't get wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University
done beautiful studies showing within mucosal lining gut
neurons sense fatty acids, sugars, amino acids, ingest
something contains one two three things, signal sent via
vagus nerve called nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
brain secretes dopamine makes us want thing, makes us


motivated pursue eat thing, either fatty, umami,
savory, sweet taste, one two three qualities, independent
taste. Now, think beautiful data, know thing, mouth.
listening just got couple fingers mouth,
sound like got something mouth. thing front face, use
speaking, front digestive tract. essentially series tubes
tube starts mouth heads stomach. so,
sense much chemical constituents stuff might bring
body might want expel not swallow not interact
able smell putrid? smell good? taste good? safe?
salty? sour fermented going poison me? bitter
poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little
receptors sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, maybe fat well. so,
incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring
not. Just can lose olfactory neurons, happen get hit
head thing, maybe infection caused loss
olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

01:19:30 Protocol 3: Learn Super-Taster Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity

fact, everybody's ability taste highly subject training. can really enhance
ability taste taste different component parts different foods simply
paying attention trying taste, amazing aspect taste

different ice cream, different beverages. somebody who, know, don't drink
much alcohol, occasionally drink something, ago got taste
bunch different white tequilas, different kinds tequilas are, not
brown, white. sort assumed tequila disgusting,
assumption this. tasted couple white tequilas realized
oh, aren't aren't bad. tasted more, pretty soon really
start detect nuance difference. Now, haven't tequilas long
time, now sort tend not drink days, short period time
like couple days got good detecting things liked start
pick tones. So, not wine drinker, are, know,
hear oh, floral tones, berry tones, chocolate tones. know,
just kind menu-based kind marketing-based silliness designed get
excited ingest. real, people
skilled assessing wines assessing foods. much eater drinker,
can really start develop sensitive palate, nuanced palette call
top-down mechanisms. olfactory cortex takes five, maybe sixth fat
receptor too, information tries make sense world.
utility is, good? bad? want less it? neural
circuitry unlike neural circuitry seems amenable behavioral
plasticity whatever reason, talk reasons might be.
know, interesting sometimes think taste literally, chemical
taste, probably different people, food tastes
probably different tastes somebody else. probably cannot
said something like vision hearing, unless somebody perfect
pitch color vision disrupted, mantis shrimp, chances


look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food

enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,

sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened

listening just got couple fingers mouth,

poison me? savory that, mmm, yes. want this. Well,
want trigger dopamine, starting mouth. So,
understand equipped amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
call mouth tongue. little bumps tongue call
papillae, not taste buds. Surrounding little papillae like little rivers
little dents indentations. dents indentations tissue
allow surface area, allow pack receptors. So,
grooves little neurons little processes little

incredible device equipped with, can use interact
various components outside world decide whether not want bring

olfactory sensory neurons, can also lose taste receptors mouth.
ever eaten something hot, not spicy hot, hot, burn
tongue, burn receptors. takes week recover receptors.
people little bit quickly, burn tongue badly ingesting soup
hot beverage hot, will greatly reduce sense taste
essentially tastes. neurons sit shallow beneath
tongue's surface, put something hot on, literally just burn
neurons away. Luckily neurons also can replenish themselves. neurons
peripheral nervous system, like peripheral system neurons can
replenish regenerate. So, burn mouth week hopefully


sooner able taste again.

look object two people seeing less object
perceiving similar way. experiments essentially establish that.
Now we, taste receptors lot tastes receptors, chemical
structures known,

01:22:20 Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas

come fancy names like T1R1 T1R2, identified
sweet umami receptors. So, interesting umami flavor savory
flavor rather sensed umami receptors close receptor detects
sweet things. Similarly, bitter sensed whole set receptors. Now,
fun naturally occurring experiment will forever change way look
animals, way certainly think dogs Costello particular.
Carnivorous large animals like tigers grizzly bears instance, know
no ability detect sweet, don't actually receptors sweet
tongue, concentration umami receptors ability detect savory
least 5,000 times humans. words, eat little piece
steak, Costello eats little piece steak, steak probably tastes much, much
savory me. dogs, tigers, bears, et cetera, going
taste savory things smell savory things much higher degree sensitivity,
can't taste sweet things. large animals, mostly herbivores like
panda bear instance. hard believe thing even bear, got nothing
pandas, just think get little bit much limelight frankly. So,
no vendetta Panda, save pandas, hope replenish pandas,
pandas whatever no umami receptors, can't taste savory,
greatly heightened density sweet receptors. So, eating
whatever bamboos day not bamboozle, bamboos day can taste
things sweet much higher degree intensity. general,
animals gentle herbivores, excuse me. animals
propensity aggression, really see divergence umami
receptor associated meat amino acids. see
enhancement sweet receptors animals eat lot plants fruits,
probably taste different me. And,
interesting note animals eat meat, eat organisms can actually


extract savory experience that.

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,
speak. avoid umami flavors meats
eat plant-based foods particular sweet foods, will likely
suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite
sensing sweet foods

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste
perception: tongue testis, although also talk ovaries.
didn't include title think reflection bias author.
author indeed not incidentally Feng Li, last name L-I. interesting paper

kind visceral sense within gut, maybe even within gonads well
something find extremely pleasurable,

01:32:28 Appetitive & Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain
Foods

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example
least case seems appetitive thing, desire move toward certain foods
maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,
effect tears suppressing areas brain involved sexual desire
testosterone males, concrete result, good result published
excellent group no pre-existing bias going in, just found.


also evidence

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted
one female another.



01:49:19 Recognizing Smell Romantic Partner

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended

new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory

believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go

01:25:05 Eating Plants Versus Eating Meat, Cravings & Desire

mean you? right, associate tiger, grizzly
bear, panda, combination both? people omnivores. However,
may find interesting people instance eat pure carnivore type diet
keto diet ingesting lot meat, therefore sensing lot umami
flavors. realized not everyone keto eats meat, will
develop sensitive palate likely data, although early data,
craving umami-like foods. Whereas people eat plant-based diet likely
developing heightened sensitivity desire for, maybe even dopamine response
sugars plant-based foods. Now, partial attempt reconcile kind
online battle seems exist plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-
based purely animal-based diets. think people omnivores, kind
interesting think systems plastic people might want meat
eat meat, people might want plants eat enough plants long
period time. might explain chasm exists two
groups. Now, not say anything ethical environmental impacts
different things, don't even want get meat people say
plant-based diets much negative impact plant people say meat
based diets, totally different discussion. talking food
craving food seeking one's ability detect umami, savory flavors going
enhanced ingesting meat less activation sweet receptors.
words, meat eat going become like tiger,

suppress umami system will heightened desire for, appetite

01:27:15 Food Makes Feel Good Bad: Taste Receptors Testes
Ovaries

foods contain sugars. tell going seem crazy,


extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors

Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize

extremely interesting respect taste taste receptors. Remember, even though
can enjoy food can evolve sense tasty not tasty, depending
life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera, taste system just like
olfactory system visual system laid purpose moving towards
things good us moving away things bad us,
kind core function nervous system. Well, taste receptors not just expressed
tongue, expressed cells tissues well.
may able imagine foods delicious make entire
body feel good. foods horrifically awful think let alone taste,
create whole body shuddering kind repellent-type response just
either cringe turn face away even absence food. sort
feel pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. like Gorgonzola cheese, don't judge
you, just, individual difference. happen love certain foods, like savory
foods much. I, think them, just make feel good.
oftentimes not even associating taste foods, feels almost like
visceral thing. Well, turns taste receptors extend beyond
tongue, actually can extend portions gut digestive system.
not strange enough, turns taste receptors actually
expressed ovaries testes. So, means gonads,
cells, tissues, organs body make reproductive axis
expressing taste receptors. Okay, interpret this? mean
eat something savory sweet instance, triggering
activation ovaries testes? Well, possible. Now, molecules,
chemical molecules actually get isn't clear, digestive track
not run directly testes ovaries. nonetheless, means
chemical sensing things detect tongue call taste
quotes food also evoking cellular responses within reproductive gonads. Now,
whether not underlies positive association

01:30:05 Biological Basis Sensuality Umami Sweet Foods

certain foods isn't clear, remiss didn't point
obvious, relationship sensual nature particular foods
sensuality generally reproductive axis something covered


many movies, entire movies focused relationship
instance, chocolate love reproductive behaviors, certain feasts meat
wonderful tastes kind sensuality around feasts different types foods,
general, sweet savory, rarely sour bitter, salty
fat. not surprisingly perhaps, T2Rs T1Rs, receptors
associated sweet umami, savory flavors expressed not
just tongue portions digestive tract, gonads themselves.
So, mean? mean eating certain foods can stimulate
gonads? Maybe, no data immediately support right now,
emerging area. like read great review, entitled Taste

even appetitive want move toward it. actually going return
general theme discussion touch sensation. people instance,
touch certain surfaces like furs, sheep skins, velvet, soft, smooth surfaces
feels good elsewhere body, not just point contact surface.
similarly, the... one? screech chalk chalkboard,
sound, strong visceral component, sandpaper, like fingernails
chalkboard, not sound, feeling, right? Exactly, whole nervous system
tuned either drawn toward appetitive, repelled aversive behaviors, right?


push-pull exists, referring terms receptors
tongue also expressed gonads yet another example

maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food

chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something

change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't

just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet

actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense

sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &

podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling

hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study

two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,

01:53:00 Rub Chemicals Others Eyes Skin, Bunting Behavior

Just haven't identified actual chemical compound acting

individuals doesn't exist, clearly does. Actually, every human
time born time die actively seeking sensing
evaluating chemicals come individuals. really nice study
done Weizmann Institute, group there, think also Noam Sobel's
group, another group well recall looking human-human interactions
meet first time. remarkable study found people
reach shake hands. typical response, know pre-pandemic,
people meet, reach shake hands.
observed almost every time within just seconds shaken hands
new individual, people will touch eyes almost without fail. Occasionally,
touch eyebrow, occasionally someone touch hair. always
associate people sort of... us sort self-


conscious response like oh, want make sure shirt tucked prim
proper, whatever is, looking right, something like teeth? kind
thing, actually people even person just met left room.
So, someone's sitting there, someone comes in, shake hands, person
inevitably subconsciously touches eyes. taking chemicals skin

nonetheless, evaluating molecules people's breath, evaluating

involved sensing not just facial expressions, size pupils, things
like that, chemicals emitting, hormone status, smell.

maybe even experiences

01:33:35 Amino Acids Key Life, Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food
Texture

associated foods. want talk particular aspect food
chemical reaction cooking called Maillard reaction. probably
heard Maillard reaction, spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. D silent, don't call
Maillard reaction, not Maillard reaction, Maillard reaction.
Maillard reaction reaction aficionados non-enzymatic browning.
form non-enzymatic browning caramelization, although hear
caramel, carmel, think caramel. think sweet, indeed caramelization
sugar-sugar chemical interaction leads kind nicely toasted not burnt,
nicely toasted sweet taste. Whereas Maillard reaction really savory reaction
occurs sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, neurons
gut, also neurons tongue neurons deep brain
comparing amount sugar savory. Okay, Maillard reaction
interesting chemists there, going way elementary.
non-chemists probably going little bit reach, just bear me,
chemicals sense different structure, like hydrogens,
oxygens, aldehyde groups, things. basically Maillard reaction
involves called free aldehyde. didn't like chemistry, don't worry it,
basically got group kind sits open allows interact
things actually use heat process call brazing,
talk moment create called ketone group. Now, people
now heard ketones 'cause think ketogenic diet, ketone
group actually chemical compound can used energy,
people say can use ketones energy, ever actually encountered
ketones, instance, get liquid ketones, ketone ester, smell it,
smell like? smells little bit like alcohol, kind savory taste,
even smell it. Okay, smells tastes too,


Maillard reaction created instance like took piece meat,
not meat eater took tomatoes cook pan
cooked nice slow till simmered almost started brown burn little bit.
Usually burns, not good cook Costello points lot, gets
like almost tangy, umami-like flavor. sometimes will even stick pan,
scrape off actually can taste mouth cooking it.
Maillard reaction, free aldehyde group, production
ketone group. smell ketones, smells much like that. Okay, people
talk ketones will produce like fruity breath. true people really
far ketosis, breath kind fruity odor, little bit different thing.
So, relationship smell taste very, close one.
people drink wine often will inhale sip, just kind
like pomp circumstance frankly, make big deal it, can sense things
mouth. combination odor receptors activated particular way,
taste receptors mouth activated particular way, triggers
activation multiple brain areas associated taste, circuitry within
body associated behaviors relate taste like leaning toward it,
leaning away depending whether not appetitive aversive.
Maillard reaction interesting reaction involving sugar amino acid thing,
really heating food amino acids available
literally chemical form detection neurons. phenomenon
occurs domains taste system. instance, lot happened
highly processed foods manufacturers figured trigger
dopamine response ingestion sugary foods created textures,
created essentially design foods two purposes. not completely demonize
processed food, previous episode, processed foods really designed
take foods ordinarily spoil, shelf life extend
shelf life turn foods not commodity commodity. Something
stored used essentially tradable purchasable, sellable resource.
change, also decided change texture want chew
them. Like thing don't know Triscuit crackers. don't
know things good? probably texture, got layers,
just kind perfectly salty. haven't one long time, bet one now
wouldn't taste good imagining it. combinations texture, smell,


taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,
effect tears suppressing areas brain involved sexual desire
testosterone males, concrete result, good result published
excellent group no pre-existing bias going in, just found.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization

McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

taste combine activate different brain areas make really want
desire something. people make foods, processed foods particular,
phenomenally good figuring drives dopamine system makes
want

01:39:00 Processed Food Make Crave Processed Foods

things either way taste and/or way
trigger neurons gut nothing taste simply make
desire food. words, many foods processed foods
make desire them, impossible eat one chip kind thing. Not
taste good, gut activating neurons activate
dopamine make seek foods independent blood sugar
anything else. So, may actually eating particular foods not
taste good, feel good tongue mouth,
neurons gut totally independent conscious taste triggering
release dopamine molecule makes seek of,

01:39:44 Protocol 4: Invert Sense Sweet & Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter
& Sweet

anything led ingestion food. fun experiment
can do, completely invert sense sweet sour,
actually way readily. post-doc, used journal club
house, people come evening month, read
paper, typically weirdest paper find eat food hang out,
nerds fun, did. one time someone
brought called miracle berry. Okay, isn't psychedelic plant medicine
thing, miracle berry, can purchase online, relatively inexpensive. actually
causes change configuration taste receptors eat
something sour, tastes sweet. really wild ingest miracle berry,
bite lemon, maybe even lemon peel tastes sweet
peach. effect lasts several hours. Definitely, know, check warnings,
don't know sort warnings these, miracle berry carries, sure


always something, can imagine. number papers miracle berry
miracle fruit called, changes perception sour perceptual level,
changing activity receptors mouth tongue. Now,
important principle underscored experiments done
instance Charles Zuker's lab Columbia University, essentially
genetically engineered animals bitter receptor swapped sweet
receptor, sweet receptor swapped bitter receptor. show
actual food, experience tongue drives different pathways
brain. did, essentially took mice swapped sweet
receptor put bitter receptor. found whereas normally
mice actively seek even work sugar water, sucrose, really like
that. replace sweet receptor bitter receptor, mice avoid
sugar water. reverse also true, mice drink bitter solution avidly,
liked bitter solution swapped bitter receptor sweet receptor.
means entire experience taste dependent
experience taste level tongue. so, hopefully not going
genetic engineering taste receptors, like sort experiment
actually can easily using miracle fruit, instructions much
ingest, et cetera, safety concerns usually package easy
find. lot science support works, kind fun experiment
anyone can will completely change perception food
accustomed eating. fact, can figure much sweet sense
sweetness contributing experience food, even don't think
sweet food miracle fruit experiment. take miracle fruit,
eat slice pepperoni pizza cheese pizza, perhaps normally
taste just like pizza, notice tastes different.

01:43:03 Pheromones, Desire Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs Males &
Females

detecting much sense sweet contributing
particular flavor. Now, like return pheromones. mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects well-established animals. one remarkable
pheromone effects ever described one actually mentioned


podcast, mention just briefly, Coolidge effect.
Coolidge effect effect male given species, cases, tended
rodent rooster mating. point reaching exhaustion inability
mate just simply couldn't whatever reason. Coolidge effect
establishes swap hen new hen, female rat mouse
new one rat rooster spontaneously regains ability mate,
somehow vigor returned, refractory period mating normally occurs
abolished can mate again. turns Coolidge effect runs
opposite direction too. not know this, recently learned study,
actually done hamsters, not mice, turns females also will, female
rodents will mate exhaustion. port... point, excuse me, will
refuse mate longer unless swap new male. mating
rodents involves female receptive, certain number behaviors
mean tell willing wanting mate, so-called lordosis reflex.
new male, will spontaneously regain lordosis reflex desire
mate. know this? know pheromonal effect? Well,
recovery desire ability mate males females can evoked
completely odor new male female, doesn't even
presentation actual animal. know not visual
interaction interaction, pheromonal interaction. Now, mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects humans debated long period time.
thought vestigial, meaning kind shrunken miniature accessory
olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, vomeronasal organ. people don't
believe Jacobson's organ exists, people do, anatomical evidence
cadavers. sits not high brain olfactory bulb is,
actually nasal passages, like little dents go
nasal passages, evidence something vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal pheromonal organ, call Jacobson's organ present
humans, kind tucked divots nasal passage. Even organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't not responsible chemical signaling
individuals, chemical signaling human beings. mentioned earlier,
effect tears suppressing areas brain involved sexual desire
testosterone males, concrete result, good result published
excellent group no pre-existing bias going in, just found.

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization

McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,

means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted

So, many examples humans, instance, people can recognize t-

So, someone's sitting there, someone comes in, shake hands, person

01:46:40 Women Influence Others Menstrual Cycles?

chemical signaling females terms synchronization
menstrual cycles. Now, original paper published 1970s
McClintock, essentially said women live together group housing,
dormitories, similar menstrual cycles synchronized due
hypothesized pheromonal effects. years, study
challenged many, many times. recent data point idea
chemical-chemical signaling women ways impact timing
menstrual cycle, depending whether not women
ovulation phase, ovulatory phase cycle whether not
follicular phase, phase follicle maturing egg actually obviates.
two separate phases 28 day menstrual cycle will either lengthen shorten
menstrual cycle person smells women. Translated English
means likely seems something, maybe pheromones,
maybe chemical independent pheromones conveyed
women housed together spend lot time together shift
menstrual cycle, doesn't necessarily mean synchronize. instance,
one woman follicular phase menstrual cycle, might shorten delay
ovulation. Excuse me, might accelerate ovulation another woman, whereas
somebody ovulatory phase cycle, might lengthen menstrual cycle
they, woman smells person's scent smells sweat,
still don't know origin chemical ovulate later. So, say
chemical-chemical signaling happening females males tears,
know that. pheromonal effect? Well, strict definition pheromone,
molecule released one individual impacts biology another
individual, yes. terms identifying pheromone tears, still
unknown, not clear chemical compound is. So, reluctant scientists
call true pheromonal effect. menstrual cycle synchronization
menstrual cycle effect seems hold conditions. cases,
kind clash menstrual cycles created chemicals emitted
one female another.
