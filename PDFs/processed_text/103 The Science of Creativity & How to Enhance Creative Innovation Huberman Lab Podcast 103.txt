supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk creativity. Now face it, word
creativity creative acts might seem somewhat abstract us. is, know
see something consider creative know see something
not creative. Things aren't creative things see every day, car
four tires, instance, bicycle two tires, not creative. However, also see things
novel different don't really think creative. fact,
can downright trivial. instance, take fish tank put wings it,
novel combination things, one key criteria act
object piece music creative. yet, neither us believe find
creative interesting fish tank wings it. not
say? Well, turns something creative actually reveal us
something fundamental world work. must say
oftentimes creative interesting beloved creative acts
reveal us something fundamental world way work way
delights thrills surprise prizes us aren't even aware
fundamental rule is. return minutes. time being, just
build first principles constitutes something creative not
constitute something creative. Creativity way interacting world
combining recombining things world way appears novel us
people. example fish tank wings novel. frankly, not
creative not interesting. doesn't reveal anything new us. Sure
flying fish although just jump far, don't really fly. consequence, putting
wings fish tank used metaphor fact fish don't fly.
already knew already knew fish don't fly. nothing novel


revealed us world except something already knew. Now, creative acts
hand, course, involve novel combinations existing rule sets
different combinations music colors shapes

00:11:16 Creativity Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy

technology, et cetera. way tells us something fundamental
different. Let give example truly creative artistic acts.
domain visual arts but, course, many examples come
music domains sport, et cetera. examples give rather fish
tank wings instance, comparison drawing accurate
painting face, Escher painting, Banksy. don't know
explain. First all, talk accurate representation face. sit
send photograph paint draw
picture face way faithfully represented, position shape
nose relative eyes, maybe curl lip, maybe hairs eyebrows
particular way, really captured accurately. think people say, OK,
accurate. looks lot like photograph person. one hand
interesting not particularly creative faithfully represents
already there. contrast, painting picture like Escher,
aren't familiar Escher's involves lot repeating patterns. instance,
bird image repeated again, sometimes
partially overlapping manner. perhaps building repeated
stones repeated staircases again.
Escher's capture elements outside world faithfully represent them,
faithfully represent again, not typically seen
natural world. fact, visual system eliminate repetitive
patterns see them. fact, visual system try make
us blind repetitive patterns visual environment allow us see things
unusual visual environment. Now, especially true visual scales.
mean go beach lie towel look
sand, start notice sand very, repetitive
pattern. small scales particular molecular scales get
level atoms forth, everything repetitive. thing, just


reproduced different combinations again. move
world, typically not looking pebbles ground little grains sand
pattern leaves particular clover something sort. time
looking landscapes people's faces, et cetera. seldom
see highly repetitive patterns scale. Escher's essentially reveal
us fundamental feature way visual system works,
repetitive patterns tend become noise visual system. is, brain encodes
repetition things not interested in. things stand
repetition things interested so-called signal noise. Escher's
invert relationship signal noise make repetitive
patterns signal unusual patterns noise. fact, every Escher
unusual patterns completely disappear us. Now, look
Escher, probably see see just bunch birds repeated
buildings staircases repeated again. may
like Escher's may not, not point. Today not talking taste
particular creative acts. trying identify rules mechanisms
constitutes something creative creative. key element
revealed Escher repetition patterns inversion
way brain normally encodes visual images. therefore, rule repetition
suppressed visual system unusual visual features revealed us,
rule pops us look Escher. Now, say pops
don't mean look Escher go oh, normally don't see repetition,
normally see unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera. seems something
truly creative acts capture attention. sometimes delight many,
many people reveal fundamental rule brain world
works. Let give different example also visual art world. Let give
example Banksy. Banksy artist many probably familiar
probably not familiar with. not
familiar Banksy, Banksy artist often two dimensional artwork.
stencils paintings drawings like many artists
urban landscape, actual city suburban landscape. is, draws stencils
graffiti cryptic way, say. No one really knows Banksy
art. just reveals art putting up. context
cities three dimensional objects. good example will stencil next


phone booth police officer. will graffiti next actual fire hydrant dog
lifting leg urinate fire hydrant. Now, interesting Banksy's not
simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature
pop us particularly exciting. feel excitement feel


really novel, different heard before, assure
revealing way auditory system often auditory
emotional system encodes information hear. again, rule
revealing not splayed you. instance, not told oh, way
normally hear now hearing things differently. Sometimes change
instance way words accented way sentences
constructed. often hear hip hop way sentences constructed can
divided not normal declarative sentences way typically written.
way sentences chopped fractured reveals us new meaning
fact, enhanced meaning particular words wouldn't see
written paragraph sung script one
read. Again, point exciting novel just
way hear it. exciting novel circuits within
brain hear see feel experience known elements new ways
truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

names things understand action steps things take.
verb actions particular brain areas engage order arrive particular
endpoint. endpoint talking today creativity. want discuss
creativity terms actually goes creative. turns just
two elements. two elements now well understood perspective
psychology fortunately, neuroscience well supports psychology says
vise versa. two elements go coming creative idea
implementing developing creative idea something real
rest world can experience divergent thinking convergent thinking.
divergent thinking convergent thinking straightforward understand.
Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.
running. musical note. jumping.
particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens
pens related pens not related to. So, again,
really important creativity basic building blocks already
existing within us. important understand somebody
really seeks creative, really need somebody forages
information structured information particular creative.
architect simply can't come incredible drawings plans buildings without
understanding buildings put together various rules govern buildings.
words, can't break rules don't understand. think movies,
especially, idea mind limitless concept
hidden geniuses somehow access math knowledge without ever
done formal math. Actually flying back Texas recently Good
Will Hunting somebody's screen. don't tend watch movies plane
often, sometimes not often. remembering movie, got

mathematics something else. idea incredible geniuses
among us just spontaneously much knowledge, far exception
rather rule, course, may not even actually exist. sure someone will
put comments examples actually exists. often not,
find people extreme virtuosity given area put many, many
years developing basic substrates, basic building blocks whatever
craft happens demonstrate virtuosity. important
understand. Nonetheless, divergent thinking critical element initiating
creative process. Again, thinking creativity verb. divergent thinking
involves taking starting point, case pen, radiating
fairly unconstrained biologists call random walk just wandering
thought

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking
exploration. Convergent thinking testing things coming
things right answer feel right. will better define right means
little bit later. already know right context
combination elements idea written passage music
physical action just know really novel really cool. people see
hear taste say, really novel really cool

meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go

pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent

something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic

lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent

However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology

bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not

mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive

01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate
ways. tells us direct maybe indirect relationship
movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.
treadmill back forth across room. fact,
absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.
state essentially not directing attention one thing external
environment, extremely key reasons now obvious. time
directing attention visual target auditory target not able
engage divergent thinking. will sometimes listen podcasts
audiobooks go runs. portions runs hikes tend turn
off just focus movement focus not focusing anything
particular. oftentimes will stop write ideas suddenly seemingly
suddenly appear geyser surface. idea. Sometimes
good ideas, sometimes less good ideas. fact happens fact
many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific
location either visual auditory, et cetera, engages nigrostriatal
pathways movement opens library ideas allows


intersection different ideas normally constrained separate categories.
One way think analogy kid go library,
nowadays just go online. different pages different books different
topics kept distinct one another. bound different book covers
book ends, different shelves library. different pages elements
books now combined pseudo random. Not random pseudo
random way. combination, new possibilities ways information
combined implemented start arise. tool emerges
simple. won't necessarily apply everybody. somebody
finds just sitting chair trying creative challenging,
might benefit from, instance, engaging writing want write talk
voice recorder phone walking simply walking not attending
one specific thing visually headphones. ideas surface,
seemingly nowhere, happens, either put
phone voice dictation type like. key thing
not distracted things phone, not start going onto social media
phone calls looking text messages definition going take
biologists call pseudo random walk. pseudo random
element extremely important. know, instance, many circuits within
brain called dedicated point point wiring. So, instance, brain
circuits govern breathing. brain circuits govern heartbeat.
brain circuits govern specific movements adult allow
smooth directed movement precise, little slop wiring. However,
aspects brain circuitry, everybody else's say,
maintained adulthood include lot extra wiring. fine wires.
not major highways different areas, will. like Google
Maps highways streets little passages alleys. little
web additional possible pathways cast entire thing. human brain
maintains webs possible passage. activities walking,
running, cycling, swimming, hiking, pacing, et cetera activation pseudo
random pathways starts ramp up. purely behavioral approach engaging
different elements within neural networks normally not communicate one
another completely still. again, practices talked earlier
completely still raise dopamine enhanced divergent thinking-- just want


reemphasize designed position ready engage activities like
walking pacing, et cetera, best facilitate divergent thinking.
somebody wants enhance divergent thinking, encourage explore
different patterns movement particular, patterns movement don't require
conscious attention one specific thing allow access new ideas new
ways combining existing elements whatever domain want creative.
Now, also opportunity underscore something said back beginning,
not going come great works music don't understand
chords melodies notes music. basic elements built
formal least rigorous regular training. way
not going take walk, suddenly able paint incredible picture
no painting ability. not going happen. talking
ways enhance capacity divergent thinking, NSDR ways
engage divergent thinking, certain forms movement don't
require lot conscious attention surroundings one specific sensory
target. so, enhancing ability

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.
number different aspects narrative theory. agree
standard definition creativity one talking before.
not talking different form creativity, talking different
way access creativity. describe standard definition creativity quote "The
ability generate novel ideas useful." commonly accepted one.
cite basis narrative theory breakthrough finding 1950s.
work Guilford people might familiar it. not
outset researching episode. theory Guilford essentially states
different intellectual capacities not captured standard IQ
tests. think generally accepted nowadays. know emotional
intelligence, know standard IQ, et cetera. important element
understand authors able trace back idea narrative training
way enhance creativity long Guilford 1950s, way back
Aristotle. incredible. Narrative theory actually birthed 335 BCE
writing called Poetics, think incredible least people long us
thinking creativity goes creativity. Aristotle said,
Guilford elaborated authors paper elaborate
actually developed training protocols for, idea three elements
can use order enhance creativity. three elements
called world building, explain moment, perspective shifting,
action generating. right off bat, word action raise flag you.
mean positive flag again, back world
therefore neural circuits movement motion. three elements world


building perspective, shifting, active generating make narrative
approach creativity. mention authors others using
approach companies, groups, individuals. using bunch
different contexts approach enhance different forms creativity. talk first
world building techniques. going immediately familiar
hear it. one key elements creativity outset come
idea makes sense attractive world different inside
creative endeavor. write science fiction think science
fiction, obvious aspects this. don't, maybe
come narrative, instance, context storytelling world
house cats cats actually ones curators
Earth. OK. right there, conceptual shift world whatever
creative idea going emerge entirely different one actually live in.
sets certain number important constraints. means certain things now
possible, things not possible different world live
in. can see parallels childhood imagination essentially anything
can happen child's mind unconstrained. second element
perspective shifting techniques. idea not supposed
reader listener observer us explore creativity develop
creative idea thinking differently generic term. actually think
differently. rather just say take perspective somebody else terms
see say think rather, supposed think
underlying motivation. world shift, world structure shift
step one. step two, ask OK, rather write
think move perspective myself, say, feeling
particularly happy day. say, actually going take perspective
somebody angry. rather just act angry, going think
motivation angry is. Maybe breakup. Maybe jealous.
Maybe somebody wronged way. Maybe just generally angry
world whatever reason operate motivational stance.
interesting powerful step really captures least viewed
me, neuroscientists, captures whole set neural circuits
motivational state means motivational states dictate huge number possible
different outcomes, really constrain number different actions


outcomes us engage in. Rather saying going view world
way someone else will view world, stating going
motivated set motivations not own, includes lot possibilities
yet not infinite number possibilities. constrained logical way,
one key elements creativity. third element, action
generating techniques really cool one will immediately notice implications
workplace, forced collaboration. inside thing building
here, story, create novel rule world story going exist
music going exist sport will exist in. create perspective
shift take motivation someone else different
force collaboration person alternate motivation different
someone else entirely different motivation. so,
create called creative collisions. Now collisions
crossing one another something new emerge them.
antagonistic. arguments fighting physical verbal Otherwise
synergistic. take number different forms depending
motivations individuals involved. even though just described
fairly top contour, just described actually core elements story
creative endeavor. just many stories perspective already
know believe think world be. perspective actions
take given world perspective. Whereas want
creative, want think outside usual framework yet using elements
exist within us no one tell us creative narrative. trying come
own. want essentially think childlike way children think? Well,
new different entirely novel concepts world works.
bounded. key word. bounded. not infinite. not
anything can happen. kids will say, can fly can shoot lasers
eyes, can things unicorns candy falling sky.
point, don't bound change world, just becomes pure chaos even
children don't that. need bound change yet create alternate
universe, will, story takes place creation kind, doesn't
story takes place. perspective shift.
useful. actually tool can use trying take perspective
others not just asking feel think do. ask


motivation life generally mood stance goal stance taking.
trying extract others? trying give others? altruistic, et
cetera, et cetera. take individual also another
individual group individuals start thinking different
individuals different motivational states engage level
action. do, say, mate, fight,
they-- et cetera, et cetera. think story. story Star Wars,
Greek myths. think story created, consider great
novel works. start find three elements-- worldbuilding, perspective
shifting, action generating techniques. is, again, just broad
contour narrative approach involves, think important
exciting one gives us formula. already know divergent thinking
convergent thinking elements creative process. suggesting
whether not involves divergent thinking not, authors seem think
distinct divergent thinking capturing elements creativity
present childhood tend disappear start assume identity, build
identity, understand rules actual world live in. basic
elements early childhood creativity can reawakened. And, fact, data
support fact can reawakened adults meaningful ways can lead
new product design, new workplace interactions, on. find

00:08:51 Creativity?

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk creativity. Now face it, word
creativity creative acts might seem somewhat abstract us. is, know
see something consider creative know see something
not creative. Things aren't creative things see every day, car
four tires, instance, bicycle two tires, not creative. However, also see things
novel different don't really think creative. fact,
can downright trivial. instance, take fish tank put wings it,
novel combination things, one key criteria act
object piece music creative. yet, neither us believe find
creative interesting fish tank wings it. not
say? Well, turns something creative actually reveal us
something fundamental world work. must say
oftentimes creative interesting beloved creative acts
reveal us something fundamental world way work way
delights thrills surprise prizes us aren't even aware
fundamental rule is. return minutes. time being, just
build first principles constitutes something creative not
constitute something creative. Creativity way interacting world
combining recombining things world way appears novel us
people. example fish tank wings novel. frankly, not
creative not interesting. doesn't reveal anything new us. Sure
flying fish although just jump far, don't really fly. consequence, putting
wings fish tank used metaphor fact fish don't fly.
already knew already knew fish don't fly. nothing novel


revealed us world except something already knew. Now, creative acts
hand, course, involve novel combinations existing rule sets
different combinations music colors shapes

00:11:16 Creativity Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy

technology, et cetera. way tells us something fundamental
different. Let give example truly creative artistic acts.
domain visual arts but, course, many examples come
music domains sport, et cetera. examples give rather fish
tank wings instance, comparison drawing accurate
painting face, Escher painting, Banksy. don't know
explain. First all, talk accurate representation face. sit
send photograph paint draw
picture face way faithfully represented, position shape
nose relative eyes, maybe curl lip, maybe hairs eyebrows
particular way, really captured accurately. think people say, OK,
accurate. looks lot like photograph person. one hand
interesting not particularly creative faithfully represents
already there. contrast, painting picture like Escher,
aren't familiar Escher's involves lot repeating patterns. instance,
bird image repeated again, sometimes
partially overlapping manner. perhaps building repeated
stones repeated staircases again.
Escher's capture elements outside world faithfully represent them,
faithfully represent again, not typically seen
natural world. fact, visual system eliminate repetitive
patterns see them. fact, visual system try make
us blind repetitive patterns visual environment allow us see things
unusual visual environment. Now, especially true visual scales.
mean go beach lie towel look
sand, start notice sand very, repetitive
pattern. small scales particular molecular scales get
level atoms forth, everything repetitive. thing, just


reproduced different combinations again. move
world, typically not looking pebbles ground little grains sand
pattern leaves particular clover something sort. time
looking landscapes people's faces, et cetera. seldom
see highly repetitive patterns scale. Escher's essentially reveal
us fundamental feature way visual system works,
repetitive patterns tend become noise visual system. is, brain encodes
repetition things not interested in. things stand
repetition things interested so-called signal noise. Escher's
invert relationship signal noise make repetitive
patterns signal unusual patterns noise. fact, every Escher
unusual patterns completely disappear us. Now, look
Escher, probably see see just bunch birds repeated
buildings staircases repeated again. may
like Escher's may not, not point. Today not talking taste
particular creative acts. trying identify rules mechanisms
constitutes something creative creative. key element
revealed Escher repetition patterns inversion
way brain normally encodes visual images. therefore, rule repetition
suppressed visual system unusual visual features revealed us,
rule pops us look Escher. Now, say pops
don't mean look Escher go oh, normally don't see repetition,
normally see unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera. seems something
truly creative acts capture attention. sometimes delight many,
many people reveal fundamental rule brain world
works. Let give different example also visual art world. Let give
example Banksy. Banksy artist many probably familiar
probably not familiar with. not
familiar Banksy, Banksy artist often two dimensional artwork.
stencils paintings drawings like many artists
urban landscape, actual city suburban landscape. is, draws stencils
graffiti cryptic way, say. No one really knows Banksy
art. just reveals art putting up. context
cities three dimensional objects. good example will stencil next


phone booth police officer. will graffiti next actual fire hydrant dog
lifting leg urinate fire hydrant. Now, interesting Banksy's not
simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature
pop us particularly exciting. feel excitement feel


really novel, different heard before, assure
revealing way auditory system often auditory
emotional system encodes information hear. again, rule
revealing not splayed you. instance, not told oh, way
normally hear now hearing things differently. Sometimes change
instance way words accented way sentences
constructed. often hear hip hop way sentences constructed can
divided not normal declarative sentences way typically written.
way sentences chopped fractured reveals us new meaning
fact, enhanced meaning particular words wouldn't see
written paragraph sung script one
read. Again, point exciting novel just
way hear it. exciting novel circuits within
brain hear see feel experience known elements new ways
truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

clear time talk mechanisms brain areas, far
important names brain areas understanding do.
couldn't remember anterior cingulate cortex fact prefrontal cortex
involved executive function, et cetera, fine. less important know
names things understand action steps things take.
verb actions particular brain areas engage order arrive particular
endpoint. endpoint talking today creativity. want discuss
creativity terms actually goes creative. turns just
two elements. two elements now well understood perspective
psychology fortunately, neuroscience well supports psychology says
vise versa. two elements go coming creative idea
implementing developing creative idea something real
rest world can experience divergent thinking convergent thinking.
divergent thinking convergent thinking straightforward understand.
Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.
running. musical note. jumping.
particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers

convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get

major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated

meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas

pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage

divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent

something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic

lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target

pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis

excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk creativity. Now face it, word
creativity creative acts might seem somewhat abstract us. is, know
see something consider creative know see something
not creative. Things aren't creative things see every day, car
four tires, instance, bicycle two tires, not creative. However, also see things
novel different don't really think creative. fact,
can downright trivial. instance, take fish tank put wings it,
novel combination things, one key criteria act
object piece music creative. yet, neither us believe find
creative interesting fish tank wings it. not
say? Well, turns something creative actually reveal us
something fundamental world work. must say
oftentimes creative interesting beloved creative acts
reveal us something fundamental world way work way
delights thrills surprise prizes us aren't even aware
fundamental rule is. return minutes. time being, just
build first principles constitutes something creative not
constitute something creative. Creativity way interacting world
combining recombining things world way appears novel us
people. example fish tank wings novel. frankly, not
creative not interesting. doesn't reveal anything new us. Sure
flying fish although just jump far, don't really fly. consequence, putting
wings fish tank used metaphor fact fish don't fly.
already knew already knew fish don't fly. nothing novel


revealed us world except something already knew. Now, creative acts
hand, course, involve novel combinations existing rule sets
different combinations music colors shapes

00:11:16 Creativity Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy

technology, et cetera. way tells us something fundamental
different. Let give example truly creative artistic acts.
domain visual arts but, course, many examples come
music domains sport, et cetera. examples give rather fish
tank wings instance, comparison drawing accurate
painting face, Escher painting, Banksy. don't know
explain. First all, talk accurate representation face. sit
send photograph paint draw
picture face way faithfully represented, position shape
nose relative eyes, maybe curl lip, maybe hairs eyebrows
particular way, really captured accurately. think people say, OK,
accurate. looks lot like photograph person. one hand
interesting not particularly creative faithfully represents
already there. contrast, painting picture like Escher,
aren't familiar Escher's involves lot repeating patterns. instance,
bird image repeated again, sometimes
partially overlapping manner. perhaps building repeated
stones repeated staircases again.
Escher's capture elements outside world faithfully represent them,
faithfully represent again, not typically seen
natural world. fact, visual system eliminate repetitive
patterns see them. fact, visual system try make
us blind repetitive patterns visual environment allow us see things
unusual visual environment. Now, especially true visual scales.
mean go beach lie towel look
sand, start notice sand very, repetitive
pattern. small scales particular molecular scales get
level atoms forth, everything repetitive. thing, just


reproduced different combinations again. move
world, typically not looking pebbles ground little grains sand
pattern leaves particular clover something sort. time
looking landscapes people's faces, et cetera. seldom
see highly repetitive patterns scale. Escher's essentially reveal
us fundamental feature way visual system works,
repetitive patterns tend become noise visual system. is, brain encodes
repetition things not interested in. things stand
repetition things interested so-called signal noise. Escher's
invert relationship signal noise make repetitive
patterns signal unusual patterns noise. fact, every Escher
unusual patterns completely disappear us. Now, look
Escher, probably see see just bunch birds repeated
buildings staircases repeated again. may
like Escher's may not, not point. Today not talking taste
particular creative acts. trying identify rules mechanisms
constitutes something creative creative. key element
revealed Escher repetition patterns inversion
way brain normally encodes visual images. therefore, rule repetition
suppressed visual system unusual visual features revealed us,
rule pops us look Escher. Now, say pops
don't mean look Escher go oh, normally don't see repetition,
normally see unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera. seems something
truly creative acts capture attention. sometimes delight many,
many people reveal fundamental rule brain world
works. Let give different example also visual art world. Let give
example Banksy. Banksy artist many probably familiar
probably not familiar with. not
familiar Banksy, Banksy artist often two dimensional artwork.
stencils paintings drawings like many artists
urban landscape, actual city suburban landscape. is, draws stencils
graffiti cryptic way, say. No one really knows Banksy
art. just reveals art putting up. context
cities three dimensional objects. good example will stencil next


phone booth police officer. will graffiti next actual fire hydrant dog
lifting leg urinate fire hydrant. Now, interesting Banksy's not
simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words

well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.

somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit

divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts

Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many

really important creativity basic building blocks already

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking

actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way

different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus

practicing open monitoring meditation just call open monitoring thinking
going immensely useful. actually opportunity queue
something mentioned episode meditation, goes deep
different meditation involving focus inward outward, et cetera. welcome

word meditation, carries bunch ideas
isn't it, meditation really just perceptual exercise. instance,
meditation look single point wall five minutes
redirect focus single point wall every time
mind drifts no doubt would. tone room. attend
redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even
eyes open stare point wall flame light. Whatever happens
allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something

revealed us world except something already knew. Now, creative acts
hand, course, involve novel combinations existing rule sets
different combinations music colors shapes

00:11:16 Creativity Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy

technology, et cetera. way tells us something fundamental
different. Let give example truly creative artistic acts.
domain visual arts but, course, many examples come
music domains sport, et cetera. examples give rather fish
tank wings instance, comparison drawing accurate
painting face, Escher painting, Banksy. don't know
explain. First all, talk accurate representation face. sit
send photograph paint draw
picture face way faithfully represented, position shape
nose relative eyes, maybe curl lip, maybe hairs eyebrows
particular way, really captured accurately. think people say, OK,
accurate. looks lot like photograph person. one hand
interesting not particularly creative faithfully represents
already there. contrast, painting picture like Escher,
aren't familiar Escher's involves lot repeating patterns. instance,
bird image repeated again, sometimes
partially overlapping manner. perhaps building repeated
stones repeated staircases again.
Escher's capture elements outside world faithfully represent them,
faithfully represent again, not typically seen
natural world. fact, visual system eliminate repetitive
patterns see them. fact, visual system try make
us blind repetitive patterns visual environment allow us see things
unusual visual environment. Now, especially true visual scales.
mean go beach lie towel look
sand, start notice sand very, repetitive
pattern. small scales particular molecular scales get
level atoms forth, everything repetitive. thing, just


reproduced different combinations again. move
world, typically not looking pebbles ground little grains sand
pattern leaves particular clover something sort. time
looking landscapes people's faces, et cetera. seldom
see highly repetitive patterns scale. Escher's essentially reveal
us fundamental feature way visual system works,
repetitive patterns tend become noise visual system. is, brain encodes
repetition things not interested in. things stand
repetition things interested so-called signal noise. Escher's
invert relationship signal noise make repetitive
patterns signal unusual patterns noise. fact, every Escher
unusual patterns completely disappear us. Now, look
Escher, probably see see just bunch birds repeated
buildings staircases repeated again. may
like Escher's may not, not point. Today not talking taste
particular creative acts. trying identify rules mechanisms
constitutes something creative creative. key element
revealed Escher repetition patterns inversion
way brain normally encodes visual images. therefore, rule repetition
suppressed visual system unusual visual features revealed us,
rule pops us look Escher. Now, say pops
don't mean look Escher go oh, normally don't see repetition,
normally see unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera. seems something
truly creative acts capture attention. sometimes delight many,
many people reveal fundamental rule brain world
works. Let give different example also visual art world. Let give
example Banksy. Banksy artist many probably familiar
probably not familiar with. not
familiar Banksy, Banksy artist often two dimensional artwork.
stencils paintings drawings like many artists
urban landscape, actual city suburban landscape. is, draws stencils
graffiti cryptic way, say. No one really knows Banksy
art. just reveals art putting up. context
cities three dimensional objects. good example will stencil next


phone booth police officer. will graffiti next actual fire hydrant dog
lifting leg urinate fire hydrant. Now, interesting Banksy's not
simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature
pop us particularly exciting. feel excitement feel


really novel, different heard before, assure
revealing way auditory system often auditory
emotional system encodes information hear. again, rule
revealing not splayed you. instance, not told oh, way
normally hear now hearing things differently. Sometimes change
instance way words accented way sentences
constructed. often hear hip hop way sentences constructed can
divided not normal declarative sentences way typically written.
way sentences chopped fractured reveals us new meaning
fact, enhanced meaning particular words wouldn't see
written paragraph sung script one
read. Again, point exciting novel just
way hear it. exciting novel circuits within
brain hear see feel experience known elements new ways
truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

idea brain areas networks involved creativity. want
clear time talk mechanisms brain areas, far
important names brain areas understanding do.
couldn't remember anterior cingulate cortex fact prefrontal cortex
involved executive function, et cetera, fine. less important know
names things understand action steps things take.
verb actions particular brain areas engage order arrive particular
endpoint. endpoint talking today creativity. want discuss
creativity terms actually goes creative. turns just
two elements. two elements now well understood perspective
psychology fortunately, neuroscience well supports psychology says
vise versa. two elements go coming creative idea
implementing developing creative idea something real
rest world can experience divergent thinking convergent thinking.
divergent thinking convergent thinking straightforward understand.
Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.
running. musical note. jumping.
particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens
pens related pens not related to. So, again,
really important creativity basic building blocks already
existing within us. important understand somebody
really seeks creative, really need somebody forages
information structured information particular creative.
architect simply can't come incredible drawings plans buildings without
understanding buildings put together various rules govern buildings.
words, can't break rules don't understand. think movies,
especially, idea mind limitless concept
hidden geniuses somehow access math knowledge without ever
done formal math. Actually flying back Texas recently Good
Will Hunting somebody's screen. don't tend watch movies plane
often, sometimes not often. remembering movie, got
math genius janitor MIT, et cetera apparently just access
knowledge. wonderful concept. very, say even exceedingly rare
thing occur world. Sure people seem natural talent


mathematics something else. idea incredible geniuses
among us just spontaneously much knowledge, far exception
rather rule, course, may not even actually exist. sure someone will
put comments examples actually exists. often not,
find people extreme virtuosity given area put many, many
years developing basic substrates, basic building blocks whatever
craft happens demonstrate virtuosity. important
understand. Nonetheless, divergent thinking critical element initiating
creative process. Again, thinking creativity verb. divergent thinking
involves taking starting point, case pen, radiating
fairly unconstrained biologists call random walk just wandering
thought

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking
exploration. Convergent thinking testing things coming
things right answer feel right. will better define right means
little bit later. already know right context
combination elements idea written passage music
physical action just know really novel really cool. people see
hear taste say, really novel really cool

enhance divergent thinking. also want share tool
shown scientific literature enhance convergent thinking
convergent divergent thinking critical creative process. Now,
emphasize people either training genetics will
naturally better divergent convergent thinking. fact, now know almost
poetic way naturally occurring variations genes underlie naturally occurring
variations percentage dopamine one set brain circuits versus another do,
seem relate whether not people naturally good divergent thinking
convergent thinking. Now, nature based explanation people
better divergent thinking people better convergent thinking.
Nature nurture something can never really teased apart exactly because,
course, someone natural proclivity something based genes,
can't often separate parents inherit genes
parents although even cases people raised away parents
adoption, et cetera. hard separate nature nurture somebody


natural proclivity things might engage things more, et cetera, et
cetera. point very, good divergent thinking
very, good convergent thinking, might inherited.
likely depended activities engaged
early years, particular years age 5 25.
aged 5 25, can say please learn engage divergent
convergent thinking much possible will enhance ability both.
25 older, can still enhance ability engage divergent
convergent thinking. fortunate news, equalizer say
regardless whether not naturally better divergent convergent thinking
acquired activities, need order creative.
know order engage divergent thinking, need access memory
banks. need come possibilities. possibilities can come
contained within memory systems brain. Areas like
hippocampus, et cetera. names don't matter. just know
going come novel combinations things novel uses things totally new
ideas objects notes music foods tastes whatever can
combined, pre-existing knowledge. yet need
order engage divergent thinking suppress called autobiographical
narratives particular, autobiographical narratives. need discard
judgments certain combinations things impacted us past.
think people mean encourage exploration creativity so-called
boundary exploration. hear lot self-help, psychology literature.
not disparaging literature although rarely define exactly
go creative case divergent
thinking. say, take risks suppress judgment.
actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way
it. One way called open monitoring meditation even just open
monitoring thinking. just make otherwise somewhat complex
section simple. also tell want enhance convergent
thinking, can number ways, can particular
different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus
position, doesn't really matter, lying down, standing up.
theory open monitoring meditation eyes open interesting
variant it. sake discussion right now, just focus study
talks specific tools way used study. title
paper essentially summarizing called open monitoring meditation reduces
involvement brain regions related memory function. Now, right off bat
will cue something interesting. Something divergent thinking open
monitoring related suppressing memory. recall, just moments ago,
said order engage divergent thinking, need kill off narratives
related come new narratives. still need
understand possibilities need forget prior understanding
possibilities start thinking possibilities be.
turns involves suppression certain brain areas. Open monitoring meditation
typically done 10 30 minutes although longer. unlike
forms meditation sit concentrate breathing trying
redirect thinking back breathing posture chant mantra,
open monitoring meditation simply matter sit lie close
eyes allow whatever surfaces mind surface. practice
practice nonjudgment. Now, nonjudgment little bit abstract theme
because, course, moment say don't judge others start judge.
just way brain works. say, don't think elephant think
elephant. perfectly natural. go edge bridge cliff
think jumping off even though don't. Please don't jump off.
part circuitry keeping jumping off. thought
happen did. OK? open monitoring meditation involves dedicating
certain amount time close eyes whatever thoughts arise,
whatever emotions arise, whatever ideas arise watch take inventory
just merely watch show pass maybe become fixated
period time maybe even just one long period time. fine.

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even

rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies

enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels

elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.

reproduced different combinations again. move
world, typically not looking pebbles ground little grains sand
pattern leaves particular clover something sort. time
looking landscapes people's faces, et cetera. seldom
see highly repetitive patterns scale. Escher's essentially reveal
us fundamental feature way visual system works,
repetitive patterns tend become noise visual system. is, brain encodes
repetition things not interested in. things stand
repetition things interested so-called signal noise. Escher's
invert relationship signal noise make repetitive
patterns signal unusual patterns noise. fact, every Escher
unusual patterns completely disappear us. Now, look
Escher, probably see see just bunch birds repeated
buildings staircases repeated again. may
like Escher's may not, not point. Today not talking taste
particular creative acts. trying identify rules mechanisms
constitutes something creative creative. key element
revealed Escher repetition patterns inversion
way brain normally encodes visual images. therefore, rule repetition
suppressed visual system unusual visual features revealed us,
rule pops us look Escher. Now, say pops
don't mean look Escher go oh, normally don't see repetition,
normally see unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera. seems something
truly creative acts capture attention. sometimes delight many,
many people reveal fundamental rule brain world
works. Let give different example also visual art world. Let give
example Banksy. Banksy artist many probably familiar
probably not familiar with. not
familiar Banksy, Banksy artist often two dimensional artwork.
stencils paintings drawings like many artists
urban landscape, actual city suburban landscape. is, draws stencils
graffiti cryptic way, say. No one really knows Banksy
art. just reveals art putting up. context
cities three dimensional objects. good example will stencil next


phone booth police officer. will graffiti next actual fire hydrant dog
lifting leg urinate fire hydrant. Now, interesting Banksy's not
simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature
pop us particularly exciting. feel excitement feel


really novel, different heard before, assure
revealing way auditory system often auditory
emotional system encodes information hear. again, rule
revealing not splayed you. instance, not told oh, way
normally hear now hearing things differently. Sometimes change
instance way words accented way sentences
constructed. often hear hip hop way sentences constructed can
divided not normal declarative sentences way typically written.
way sentences chopped fractured reveals us new meaning
fact, enhanced meaning particular words wouldn't see
written paragraph sung script one
read. Again, point exciting novel just
way hear it. exciting novel circuits within
brain hear see feel experience known elements new ways
truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

names things understand action steps things take.
verb actions particular brain areas engage order arrive particular
endpoint. endpoint talking today creativity. want discuss
creativity terms actually goes creative. turns just
two elements. two elements now well understood perspective
psychology fortunately, neuroscience well supports psychology says
vise versa. two elements go coming creative idea
implementing developing creative idea something real
rest world can experience divergent thinking convergent thinking.
divergent thinking convergent thinking straightforward understand.
Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.
running. musical note. jumping.
particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens
pens related pens not related to. So, again,
really important creativity basic building blocks already
existing within us. important understand somebody
really seeks creative, really need somebody forages
information structured information particular creative.
architect simply can't come incredible drawings plans buildings without
understanding buildings put together various rules govern buildings.
words, can't break rules don't understand. think movies,
especially, idea mind limitless concept
hidden geniuses somehow access math knowledge without ever
done formal math. Actually flying back Texas recently Good
Will Hunting somebody's screen. don't tend watch movies plane
often, sometimes not often. remembering movie, got
math genius janitor MIT, et cetera apparently just access
knowledge. wonderful concept. very, say even exceedingly rare
thing occur world. Sure people seem natural talent


mathematics something else. idea incredible geniuses
among us just spontaneously much knowledge, far exception
rather rule, course, may not even actually exist. sure someone will
put comments examples actually exists. often not,
find people extreme virtuosity given area put many, many
years developing basic substrates, basic building blocks whatever
craft happens demonstrate virtuosity. important
understand. Nonetheless, divergent thinking critical element initiating
creative process. Again, thinking creativity verb. divergent thinking
involves taking starting point, case pen, radiating
fairly unconstrained biologists call random walk just wandering
thought

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called

people find quickly within days get better open

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love

brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New

meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing

pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase
divergent convergent thinking. timestamped episode. refer

01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate
ways. tells us direct maybe indirect relationship
movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.
treadmill back forth across room. fact,
absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.
state essentially not directing attention one thing external
environment, extremely key reasons now obvious. time
directing attention visual target auditory target not able
engage divergent thinking. will sometimes listen podcasts
audiobooks go runs. portions runs hikes tend turn
off just focus movement focus not focusing anything
particular. oftentimes will stop write ideas suddenly seemingly
suddenly appear geyser surface. idea. Sometimes
good ideas, sometimes less good ideas. fact happens fact
many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific
location either visual auditory, et cetera, engages nigrostriatal
pathways movement opens library ideas allows


intersection different ideas normally constrained separate categories.
One way think analogy kid go library,
nowadays just go online. different pages different books different
topics kept distinct one another. bound different book covers
book ends, different shelves library. different pages elements
books now combined pseudo random. Not random pseudo
random way. combination, new possibilities ways information
combined implemented start arise. tool emerges
simple. won't necessarily apply everybody. somebody
finds just sitting chair trying creative challenging,
might benefit from, instance, engaging writing want write talk
voice recorder phone walking simply walking not attending
one specific thing visually headphones. ideas surface,
seemingly nowhere, happens, either put
phone voice dictation type like. key thing
not distracted things phone, not start going onto social media
phone calls looking text messages definition going take
biologists call pseudo random walk. pseudo random
element extremely important. know, instance, many circuits within
brain called dedicated point point wiring. So, instance, brain
circuits govern breathing. brain circuits govern heartbeat.
brain circuits govern specific movements adult allow
smooth directed movement precise, little slop wiring. However,
aspects brain circuitry, everybody else's say,
maintained adulthood include lot extra wiring. fine wires.
not major highways different areas, will. like Google
Maps highways streets little passages alleys. little
web additional possible pathways cast entire thing. human brain
maintains webs possible passage. activities walking,
running, cycling, swimming, hiking, pacing, et cetera activation pseudo
random pathways starts ramp up. purely behavioral approach engaging
different elements within neural networks normally not communicate one
another completely still. again, practices talked earlier
completely still raise dopamine enhanced divergent thinking-- just want


reemphasize designed position ready engage activities like
walking pacing, et cetera, best facilitate divergent thinking.
somebody wants enhance divergent thinking, encourage explore
different patterns movement particular, patterns movement don't require
conscious attention one specific thing allow access new ideas new
ways combining existing elements whatever domain want creative.
Now, also opportunity underscore something said back beginning,
not going come great works music don't understand

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.
number different aspects narrative theory. agree

Aristotle. incredible. Narrative theory actually birthed 335 BCE
writing called Poetics, think incredible least people long us
thinking creativity goes creativity. Aristotle said,
Guilford elaborated authors paper elaborate
actually developed training protocols for, idea three elements
can use order enhance creativity. three elements
called world building, explain moment, perspective shifting,
action generating. right off bat, word action raise flag you.

simply fact puts two dimensional art onto three dimensional surfaces
urban suburban landscape think it, done many,
many times before. graffiti that. City Art murals that. unique
Banksy? unique Banksy say Banksy's, actual art,
combines two dimensional art three dimensional landscape way
concept pops you. mean that? Well, case dog lifting
leg urinate fire hydrant, scene people fact,
children familiar cartoons basic understanding
stereotype dogs must tell owned male dog, bulldog Costello
many years. Hydrants particular target Costello. course, everything
particular target Costello urinating outdoors. Nonetheless, liked pee fire
hydrants. not interesting. Seeing photograph dog raising leg pee
fire hydrant not interesting. Seeing painting isn't interesting. Seeing
actual dog urinating fire hydrant isn't interesting. fact, seeing painting two
dimensions dog raising leg to, course, can't actually urinate give
impression urinate fire hydrant isn't particularly interesting except
fact reveals us something fundamental, tend pair visual
relationships different objects share common theme theme
tends pop us. So, instance, dog raising leg next fire hydrant even
dog drawn two dimensions fire hydrant three dimensions allows
concept dog fire hydrant emerge pop us, reveals us
something fundamental brain works, brain encodes
concepts entire stories symbols interaction different objects. Let
give different example just make sure hits home. One Banksy's
famous paintings rather politically charged one, girl holding bouquet
balloons. two dimensional drawing put West wall dividing
territories Middle East. controversial issue. controversies issue
not want get into. don't think anyone doubt
controversial issue. two dimensional drawing girl balloons
actual wall turns quite interesting art piece reveals us
entire controversy around presence wall desire certain
people breach wall desire people insist wall not


breached whatever reason. Again, not particular controversy,
point two dimensional image combined three dimensional structure
allows purpose three dimensional structure. controversy around
three dimensional structure pop us way if, instance, just
seen photograph somebody next wall ladder just seen
drawing girl holding bouquet balloons drawing wall not emerge.
words, captures two fundamental features visual system. ability
encode things two dimensions understand symbols. ability understand
things three dimensions. particular, wall three dimensional object
really interesting actual physical barrier. showing actual
physical barrier real space, three dimensions turns allow
interaction two things. concept, controversy pop us
make us think particular controversy perhaps individually
stand controversy. Now, many examples just gave
visual domain. instance, Rothko's just color Canvas particularly
interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature
pop us particularly exciting. feel excitement feel


really novel, different heard before, assure
revealing way auditory system often auditory
emotional system encodes information hear. again, rule
revealing not splayed you. instance, not told oh, way
normally hear now hearing things differently. Sometimes change
instance way words accented way sentences
constructed. often hear hip hop way sentences constructed can
divided not normal declarative sentences way typically written.
way sentences chopped fractured reveals us new meaning
fact, enhanced meaning particular words wouldn't see
written paragraph sung script one
read. Again, point exciting novel just
way hear it. exciting novel circuits within
brain hear see feel experience known elements new ways
truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

important names brain areas understanding do.
couldn't remember anterior cingulate cortex fact prefrontal cortex

names things understand action steps things take.
verb actions particular brain areas engage order arrive particular
endpoint. endpoint talking today creativity. want discuss
creativity terms actually goes creative. turns just
two elements. two elements now well understood perspective
psychology fortunately, neuroscience well supports psychology says
vise versa. two elements go coming creative idea
implementing developing creative idea something real
rest world can experience divergent thinking convergent thinking.
divergent thinking convergent thinking straightforward understand.
Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.
running. musical note. jumping.
particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens
pens related pens not related to. So, again,
really important creativity basic building blocks already
existing within us. important understand somebody
really seeks creative, really need somebody forages
information structured information particular creative.
architect simply can't come incredible drawings plans buildings without
understanding buildings put together various rules govern buildings.
words, can't break rules don't understand. think movies,
especially, idea mind limitless concept
hidden geniuses somehow access math knowledge without ever
done formal math. Actually flying back Texas recently Good
Will Hunting somebody's screen. don't tend watch movies plane
often, sometimes not often. remembering movie, got
math genius janitor MIT, et cetera apparently just access
knowledge. wonderful concept. very, say even exceedingly rare
thing occur world. Sure people seem natural talent


mathematics something else. idea incredible geniuses
among us just spontaneously much knowledge, far exception
rather rule, course, may not even actually exist. sure someone will
put comments examples actually exists. often not,
find people extreme virtuosity given area put many, many
years developing basic substrates, basic building blocks whatever
craft happens demonstrate virtuosity. important
understand. Nonetheless, divergent thinking critical element initiating
creative process. Again, thinking creativity verb. divergent thinking
involves taking starting point, case pen, radiating
fairly unconstrained biologists call random walk just wandering
thought

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind

area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine

concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love

brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain

exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related

interesting source information way brain encodes color. Later fill
exactly information is. may like Rothko's, may not. tell
one thing. look Rothko, seeing colors different way
ever see colors context. fact don't frame
typically fact no white canvas allows colors see
novel hues colors will not see context.
reveals brain order understand extract color. Now
context music, instance, will sometimes hear street musician play song
maybe Bob Dylan song Led Zeppelin song Pink Floyd song pretty closely,
pretty accurately way song played. But, course, not creative.
just like photograph accurate portrait somebody's face. may hear
acoustic version normally electric guitar song electrical song vise
versa. Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better original not
particularly creative. However, every one us particular taste music.
Maybe classical, maybe rock, maybe punk, maybe hip hop. Within
genres, think us familiar hearing something first time
maybe even every time. something combination words
music sometimes just music just words allows feature

truly creative, way neural circuits function changed.
neural circuits change way function simply way comes
eyes, ears, way experience feelings, release
chemicals, including release chemical dopamine neuromodulators
well make us feel surprised, delighted.

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

Divergent thinking taking known object event world sport concept.

particular color piece paper. asking many different things
thing actually be. might say, well, running running. use divergent
thinking way illustrate divergent thinking is. show picture
somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think
based picture see somebody running. Now, able engage


divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert

situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts

underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can

Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no

perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens

convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure

convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage

words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine

much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities

me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way

important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative

one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels

elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior

activity. Theta activity pattern brain wave activity commonly associated
creative states divergent thinking particular. important. observe
across subjects specifically nigrostriatal pathway. pathway associated
divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated
visual imagery visual so-called occipital cortex parietal cortex
shown studies ramp people motionless. seems
inverse relationship movement visual imagery makes sense.
moving can pay attention things outside world, tend
aware sensory environment varying degrees. don't tend
focused visual imagery within head whereas lie sit
close eyes motionless, degree visual imagery really increases.
Hence, increase divergent thinking essentially happening


library options, library possible interactions whatever
thinking about. gave example, trivial one purpose pen.
bank options becomes available motionless
limiting visualization external world increases exponentially.
important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes
closed allowing mind drift, wherever happens go, focusing relaxing
long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively
motionless really favors brain states associated divergent thinking. actually
represents accessing various components use divergent
thinking. perhaps excitingly, associated massive increase, 65%
increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent

deep relaxation. Again, happen fall asleep, not necessarily bad thing,


although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem
solving task, picture concept task, don't expect recognize know

know standard task assessing divergent thinking. tested
taking microdose effects expected manifested
say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores

00:23:37 Neural Circuits Creativity

key, excited anticipation might see again.
understanding mind true creativity involves l combination elements
notes music, numbers, visual elements like lines colors,
physical movements, et cetera. novel combinations things
reveal us something fundamental way brain and/or world work.
course, mentioned before, fundamental thing may may not
consciously accessible us. may not know exactly novel us.
feels novel feels true. Well, understanding mind, therefore can ask,
underlying principles neural circuits underlie creative process.
word process especially important. fact, one thing really
like impress everybody thinking biology, almost always
better think verbs opposed nouns. rather think creativity


noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent

meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go

pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage

divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent

something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.

nidra NSDR discussed many times podcast. Yoga nidra,
instance, practice around hundreds not thousands years
people deliberately lie still. forcing mostly motionless,
small movements fine. directing attention surface
body, long exhale breathing. Sometimes intentions, sometimes
visualization. really self-directed relaxation. key component people
stay awake engage little movement. key word movement.
Now, nonsleep depressed acronym, term coined. not term coined
order try wipe away discard yoga nidra. person great
respect yoga nidra traditions. term coined order encompass
number practices don't include mystical type language scientific language
matter. doesn't involve intentions. involves deep relaxation yet
remaining wide awake conscious. Sometimes people fall asleep OK.
really atypical brain state deeply relaxed yet general awake
motionless. Again, motionless key. brain states involve us
mostly not completely motionless yet awake. turns brain state
whether not call yoga nidra, call NSDR, whether not call
meditation induced shift consciousness study, although
refer yoga nidra, refer thing, motionless yet aware

relatively motionless although small movements body movements head
absolutely fine. observed 65% increase dopamine release. Now,
key. Dopamine release. observed increase so-called theta
activity. Theta activity pattern brain wave activity commonly associated
creative states divergent thinking particular. important. observe
across subjects specifically nigrostriatal pathway. pathway associated
divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated
visual imagery visual so-called occipital cortex parietal cortex
shown studies ramp people motionless. seems
inverse relationship movement visual imagery makes sense.
moving can pay attention things outside world, tend
aware sensory environment varying degrees. don't tend
focused visual imagery within head whereas lie sit
close eyes motionless, degree visual imagery really increases.
Hence, increase divergent thinking essentially happening


library options, library possible interactions whatever
thinking about. gave example, trivial one purpose pen.
bank options becomes available motionless
limiting visualization external world increases exponentially.
important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes
closed allowing mind drift, wherever happens go, focusing relaxing
long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively
motionless really favors brain states associated divergent thinking. actually
represents accessing various components use divergent
thinking. perhaps excitingly, associated massive increase, 65%
increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent
thinking creative ability, practice minimum per
week. say going per week, recommend
20 30 minutes. might able long 60
minutes. practice daily basis, anywhere 10 minutes 20
minutes, sometimes 30 minutes. example NSDR script, completely zero
cost. confess happen voice. forgive advance.
options NSDR. can go YouTube, put NSDR name. Again, completely
zero cost. can get sample 10 minute NSDR script looks like.
Virtusan, put there. thank Virtusan putting
zero cost. examples 20 30 minute NSDR scripts yoga nidra scripts.
particularly like. will also provide link those. Again,
completely zero cost explore. important follow one
particular yoga nidra NSDR script learn take body brain

deep relaxation. Again, happen fall asleep, not necessarily bad thing,


although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem
solving task, picture concept task, don't expect recognize know
assesses convergent thinking alternative uses task also don't expect
know standard task assessing divergent thinking. tested
taking microdose effects expected manifested
say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase
divergent convergent thinking. timestamped episode. refer

influence cannabis particular high THC containing cannabis
lead enhanced divergent thinking, enhanced turns oftentimes
ideas can't constrained convergent thinking process. words,

absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.

many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific

intersection different ideas normally constrained separate categories.
One way think analogy kid go library,
nowadays just go online. different pages different books different

seemingly nowhere, happens, either put
phone voice dictation type like. key thing
not distracted things phone, not start going onto social media
phone calls looking text messages definition going take
biologists call pseudo random walk. pseudo random
element extremely important. know, instance, many circuits within
brain called dedicated point point wiring. So, instance, brain
circuits govern breathing. brain circuits govern heartbeat.
brain circuits govern specific movements adult allow
smooth directed movement precise, little slop wiring. However,

completely still raise dopamine enhanced divergent thinking-- just want


reemphasize designed position ready engage activities like
walking pacing, et cetera, best facilitate divergent thinking.
somebody wants enhance divergent thinking, encourage explore
different patterns movement particular, patterns movement don't require

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways

noun somebody creative adjective, think verb creativity.
steps required therefore cells circuits thoughts, et
cetera required order creative. element thinking verbs allows
us say, OK, various steps coming creative idea, testing
creative idea, implementing creative idea. so, find based
scientific literature basically three major networks within brain,
responsible three steps arrive something truly
creative. first neural circuit involved creativity so-called executive network.
goofy name neural circuits describe bunch
things well, certainly control called executive functions.
Executive functions functions have, ability govern
thinking behavior deliberate ways. largely accomplished
use neural circuitry sits right behind forebrain, so-called
prefrontal cortex. Now, prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions.
bunch different parts just like country different states, et cetera provinces.
Executive function involves prefrontal cortex neural structures.
sake discussion, executive function prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible suppressing action. is, eliminating choices among infinite
number choices exist. instance, colors combine painting
lines draw notes play movements make sports
endeavor, numbers include mathematics endeavor, words
letters syllables sentences include writing creative passage. second
network so-called default mode network. lot discussion nowadays
default mode network relates consciousness meditation, et cetera.
default mode network many different things. context
discussion creativity, default mode network really network starts
engaged close eyes start paying attention going
terms thinking opposed sensory outside world. default mode
network especially important called spontaneous imagination. Now,
spontaneous imagination something can try moment
close eyes try not pay attention sounds around you. even
do, just pay attention whatever thoughts feelings emerge eyes
closed. closing eyes shutting off outside sensory world,
start engage much brain machinery dedicated towards going


inside you, so-called interoception also thinking thinking
whether not thoughts complete incomplete, whether not
fragmentary way goes one thought another distantly past
present future, et cetera. Depending time day, well-rested are,
stressed are, happy are, default mode network will take
journey different types thoughts, different types feelings, et cetera. specific
types thoughts feelings not interesting fact close
eyes essentially engaging default mode network, essentially
network associated imagination imagination based elements exist
within head, within brain therefore must rely memory previous
experiences. soon close eyes, shutting off
sensory world. definition can no longer bringing novel experiences
moment. relying library existing experiences memory
order imagine new things. free associative
way. not trying imagine new things. just whatever geysers surface.
got executive network, involved suppressing particular thoughts
actions. default mode network, involved imagination.
default mode network mention also involves subregion prefrontal cortex.
called medial prefrontal cortex brain regions well. final
element within circuits underlying creativity so-called salience network.
salience network network brain regions involves areas Insula,
actually complete map body surface well information
mapped going outside world combined
going internal landscape, within body. Also brain region
called ACC intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex amygdala.
lot information mapped within salience network feel
feel relation things happening around us within us. salience
network one main job, pay attention interesting either
world inside us terms feelings experiences. got three networks--
executive network, suppress choices terms actions take
decide not to, things think choose not try not to,
default mode network, basically catalog library previous experiences
available us act paints palette possible
ingredients go recipe. to, again, arise previous


experience. can't close eyes suddenly able access melodies
never heard ideas concepts knowledge music
don't musical understanding visual understanding. really drawing
library. library tends rather disorganized. swirls around. not
structured unless actively trying think something.
salience network, networks within brain decide make choices
interesting pay attention given moment. three
networks work together create things. say create things,
really definition creativity. Creativity rearrangement existing elements novel
combinations reveal something fundamental world works. And,
important. tends things useful. Now, can merely
useful entertaining thrilling, can also particular utility
use world like piece technology actually useful like app
smartphone computer actually utility vehicle. creative acts
led formation vehicles computers, et cetera. point just merely
coming novel combinations things like wings fish tank, not creative
not creative meaningful way simply not useful. doesn't reveal
anything fundamental new purposeful. doesn't allow us think interact
world novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, ideas
truly creative really change way

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated

meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas

pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent

something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking

highlight meditation used study isn't really meditation all. don't know
selected title. behavioral protocol used study
akin normally called yoga nidra NSDR nonsleep depressed. Now yoga
nidra NSDR discussed many times podcast. Yoga nidra,
instance, practice around hundreds not thousands years
people deliberately lie still. forcing mostly motionless,
small movements fine. directing attention surface
body, long exhale breathing. Sometimes intentions, sometimes
visualization. really self-directed relaxation. key component people
stay awake engage little movement. key word movement.
Now, nonsleep depressed acronym, term coined. not term coined
order try wipe away discard yoga nidra. person great
respect yoga nidra traditions. term coined order encompass
number practices don't include mystical type language scientific language
matter. doesn't involve intentions. involves deep relaxation yet
remaining wide awake conscious. Sometimes people fall asleep OK.
really atypical brain state deeply relaxed yet general awake
motionless. Again, motionless key. brain states involve us
mostly not completely motionless yet awake. turns brain state
whether not call yoga nidra, call NSDR, whether not call

creative states divergent thinking particular. important. observe
across subjects specifically nigrostriatal pathway. pathway associated
divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated
visual imagery visual so-called occipital cortex parietal cortex
shown studies ramp people motionless. seems
inverse relationship movement visual imagery makes sense.
moving can pay attention things outside world, tend
aware sensory environment varying degrees. don't tend
focused visual imagery within head whereas lie sit
close eyes motionless, degree visual imagery really increases.
Hence, increase divergent thinking essentially happening


library options, library possible interactions whatever
thinking about. gave example, trivial one purpose pen.
bank options becomes available motionless
limiting visualization external world increases exponentially.
important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes
closed allowing mind drift, wherever happens go, focusing relaxing
long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively
motionless really favors brain states associated divergent thinking. actually
represents accessing various components use divergent
thinking. perhaps excitingly, associated massive increase, 65%
increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent

deep relaxation. Again, happen fall asleep, not necessarily bad thing,


although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem
solving task, picture concept task, don't expect recognize know

know standard task assessing divergent thinking. tested
taking microdose effects expected manifested
say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get

me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional

major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas

pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage

divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent

something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent

dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

creative states divergent thinking particular. important. observe
across subjects specifically nigrostriatal pathway. pathway associated
divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated
visual imagery visual so-called occipital cortex parietal cortex
shown studies ramp people motionless. seems
inverse relationship movement visual imagery makes sense.
moving can pay attention things outside world, tend

focused visual imagery within head whereas lie sit
close eyes motionless, degree visual imagery really increases.
Hence, increase divergent thinking essentially happening

important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes

long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively

increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent

options NSDR. can go YouTube, put NSDR name. Again, completely
zero cost. can get sample 10 minute NSDR script looks like.
Virtusan, put there. thank Virtusan putting
zero cost. examples 20 30 minute NSDR scripts yoga nidra scripts.
particularly like. will also provide link those. Again,
completely zero cost explore. important follow one
particular yoga nidra NSDR script learn take body brain

deep relaxation. Again, happen fall asleep, not necessarily bad thing,


although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase

creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind

area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine

fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland

new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation

telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,

meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can

increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related

speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative

somebody running, say, you. See say see somebody running.
might give divergent thinking task tasks ones used
various experiments. say, many different things can think

correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can

Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer

just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying

really important creativity basic building blocks already

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love

brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense

divergent thinking, say running store. Running away lion.
Running towards somebody love. maybe elaborate imagination
say, running front bus grab kid kid doesn't get hit
bus. running toward concert excited particular concert
starts spool story. words, divergent thinking involves taking
one simple call neuroscience psychology stimulus, one image,
sound, et cetera trying radiate many different divergent
situations, properties, characteristics, events, things one specific element.
divergent thinking task involve exactly that. show pictures play
sounds words notes describe events history try see many
things can radiate diverse, diverse, even distant types concepts
pictures. OK. divergent thinking. Divergent thinking really process
underlies idea generation. basis divergent thinking one idea
correct. fact, ideas one thing, better
divergent thinking. give three minutes list off things can
think related pen holding up. listening just
holding pen front me. just write say out. next 3
minutes example divergent thinking. However, just said black
pen, red pen, white pen, green pen, et cetera, not divergent thinking.
divergent context color space. say space just nerd speak
one particular domain thinking. Whereas said red pen, white pen, essay pen
door hold door open someone can return building. started
spooling off story related important, well, go.
Divergent thinking essentially taking one element coming many, many
answers. context divergent thinking, answer goes, soon
learn, not every answer interesting relevant not every answer help solve
something reveal something fundamental therefore, not every divergent answer
truly creative. aspect divergent thinking really important understand
selection criteria extremely vague vast. is, no
constraints come with. hold pen say, orangutan,
perfectly valid divergent idea pen thought
distantly related. However, remember earlier rule. black pen
orangutan not linked brain, observer's brain meaningful way,
interesting one understands rule


underlies link pen orangutan. Whereas come
something different somehow tells everybody else something interesting
pens orangutans, now truly creative idea. don't example
mind later give examples can actually March
path divergent thinking use executive network suppress certain options
cross off certain answers because, again, answer valid not valid answers
interesting useful. can cross off arrive interesting
truly creative answer. couple things divergent thinking. Divergent
thinking largely taps networks brain involved mental flexibility.
different aspect prefrontal cortex, not based executive
function ability reduce options rather areas prefrontal cortex
available generate multiple options actually suppress context forget pens
just writing, instance, pens can things like hold door open.
really unusual use pen. Again, none examples giving
particularly interesting. just designed get understand underlying
concept divergent thinking. last thing like know divergent
thinking divergent thinking involves exploration. wandering
ideas already library, memory banks pens
pens related pens not related to. So, again,
really important creativity basic building blocks already
existing within us. important understand somebody
really seeks creative, really need somebody forages
information structured information particular creative.
architect simply can't come incredible drawings plans buildings without
understanding buildings put together various rules govern buildings.
words, can't break rules don't understand. think movies,
especially, idea mind limitless concept
hidden geniuses somehow access math knowledge without ever
done formal math. Actually flying back Texas recently Good
Will Hunting somebody's screen. don't tend watch movies plane
often, sometimes not often. remembering movie, got
math genius janitor MIT, et cetera apparently just access

mathematics something else. idea incredible geniuses
among us just spontaneously much knowledge, far exception
rather rule, course, may not even actually exist. sure someone will
put comments examples actually exists. often not,
find people extreme virtuosity given area put many, many
years developing basic substrates, basic building blocks whatever
craft happens demonstrate virtuosity. important
understand. Nonetheless, divergent thinking critical element initiating
creative process. Again, thinking creativity verb. divergent thinking
involves taking starting point, case pen, radiating
fairly unconstrained biologists call random walk just wandering
thought

00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking

space memory space related pen. Now, flip side
creativity implementation specific combinations things testing
see whether not interesting, relevant, delight us people scare
us people thrill us people. words, testing whether not
fundamental rule emerge. Again, going repeat many, many
times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure
answers, convergent thinking modes can take
answer valid. not many. really
important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine
combined within things fundamental features, fact, necessary
not sufficient plane can land water. OK. just one
example convergent thinking. convergent thinking task involve
given list two three maybe even five different things.
two three five different things, quickly can come single
answer binds real world concept obey laws nature
physics way. instance, can just come answer said,
bird swallowed engine happens sea bird. come
that, actually not something happens typical all.
seems like mishmash things really just designed try
accomplish answer rather something real, plane lands water.
OK. point divergent thinking one aspect cognition,
thinking. convergent thinking distinct aspect cognition. fact, one
critical requirements convergent thinking also access memory banks
understanding outside world just divergent thinking,
requires focus persistence. fact, come key rule
divergent thinking, almost want just enough focus
remember initial object thing mentioned keep mind
answers don't become completely random. distant
everywhere can generate answers is, things
close pens, black pen, red pen versus pen doorstop, pen acting doorstop.
are-- one close, red pen close black pen, doorstop pretty far
black pen. idea. want explore undergo range
exploration different ideas whereas convergent thinking, really trying
bind things together. key element convergent thinking aspect
persistence focus. convergent thinking many ways feels harder
divergent thinking. feels like answer. want get answer right
can't solve it. puzzle puzzle



00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking
exploration. Convergent thinking testing things coming
things right answer feel right. will better define right means
little bit later. already know right context
combination elements idea written passage music
physical action just know really novel really cool. people see
hear taste say, really novel really cool

Nature nurture something can never really teased apart exactly because,
course, someone natural proclivity something based genes,

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative

meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,

one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels

elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent

discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine

wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior

times throughout episode not going apologize think
important understand creativity not just novel combinations. novel
combinations things reveal something fundamental. often pop us
not every time certainly time see thing. almost never seems
case something truly creative dulls expression.
repeating us fundamental rule normally can't
see hear experience absence creative act. second part
creativity things tested truly creative elements discovered
convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image
tell following things, say wing, water, engine. concept happen
mind plane can land water. planes don't land water
not intended land water. One hope plane doesn't land water
unless plane designed land water. case, plane can land


water one answers can combine wing, water, engine. sure

important not asking spool radiate three things.
Rather, asking combine way makes sense real world.
indeed planes can land water. wing water engine

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking

actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way
it. One way called open monitoring meditation even just open

different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact

meditation regular basis improves divergent thinking capability. terms tools,
practicing open monitoring meditation just call open monitoring thinking
going immensely useful. actually opportunity queue
something mentioned episode meditation, goes deep
different meditation involving focus inward outward, et cetera. welcome
check episode. hubermanlab.com. point rather think
word meditation, carries bunch ideas
isn't it, meditation really just perceptual exercise. instance,
meditation look single point wall five minutes
redirect focus single point wall every time
mind drifts no doubt would. tone room. attend
redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even
eyes open stare point wall flame light. Whatever happens
allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people

convergent thinking. convergent thinking is, name suggests, just opposite
divergent thinking. Convergent thinking be, example, give image

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major

distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing

allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get

immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus
outside. Again, music, exercise, excellent way elevate
dopamine. talk another well-established one research literature
known elevate dopamine 65% particular pathway relevant divergent

need decide given moment given work attempt creativity
need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk
little bit means three step process just little bit.
strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages
dosages caffeine safe fact, performance enhancing covered

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit

anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.

associated pituitary. no way direct dopamine activation just one
pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress
psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera, reduce dopamine.
people oftentimes will problems movement. will express

selected title. behavioral protocol used study
akin normally called yoga nidra NSDR nonsleep depressed. Now yoga
nidra NSDR discussed many times podcast. Yoga nidra,
instance, practice around hundreds not thousands years
people deliberately lie still. forcing mostly motionless,
small movements fine. directing attention surface
body, long exhale breathing. Sometimes intentions, sometimes
visualization. really self-directed relaxation. key component people
stay awake engage little movement. key word movement.
Now, nonsleep depressed acronym, term coined. not term coined

many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR

not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind

remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine

Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct

actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way
it. One way called open monitoring meditation even just open

different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus

laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing

rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly

immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus

need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can

00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways

relies distinct brain circuits divergent thinking. brain circuits? Well,
going describe next. again, not just going list
different brain circuits different names different things, wouldn't useful
me. Rather, learn truly incredible.
going talk one single molecule-- dopamine, molecule typically
associated motivation desire drive feelings pleasure cases.
actually resides within four different networks brain. Today going
talk two networks. dopamine acting one network directly underlies
divergent thinking. Whereas dopamine another brain network underlies convergent
thinking. point episode saying OK, going get
tools understand creativity creative, can assure
understand divergent thinking hopefully now do, can understand
convergent thinking is, can understand dopamine responsible
divergent thinking convergent thinking separate pathways. Well,
can understand two separate pathways work engage
differentially, therein lie tools can use explore ideas.
words, find creative. systematically test
ideas truly creative. meets criteria something novel
truly useful informs us something never seen, heard, felt
before. just take moment talk incredible molecule dopamine.
Many people familiar dopamine concept quote unquote "dopamine
hits," popular language describing feeling pleasure get pretty
much anything like continue engage repeatedly. people
will talk dopamine hit get somebody attractive like
texting back dopamine hit get social media dopamine
hit get sugar dopamine get that.
honest, concept dopamine hits not one favor general,
whenever people talk dopamine hits, typically talking activities
social media dopamine may involved level. often
case behavior associated thing case, social media
compulsive nature rather active seeking something positive anticipation.


really dopamine least context one major
functions brain. Dopamine really motivation desire movement.
makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking
exploration. Convergent thinking testing things coming
things right answer feel right. will better define right means
little bit later. already know right context
combination elements idea written passage music
physical action just know really novel really cool. people see

poetic way naturally occurring variations genes underlie naturally occurring
variations percentage dopamine one set brain circuits versus another do,
seem relate whether not people naturally good divergent thinking
convergent thinking. Now, nature based explanation people
better divergent thinking people better convergent thinking.
Nature nurture something can never really teased apart exactly because,
course, someone natural proclivity something based genes,
can't often separate parents inherit genes

not disparaging literature although rarely define exactly
go creative case divergent

actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way
it. One way called open monitoring meditation even just open
monitoring thinking. just make otherwise somewhat complex
section simple. also tell want enhance convergent
thinking, can number ways, can particular
different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus
position, doesn't really matter, lying down, standing up.
theory open monitoring meditation eyes open interesting
variant it. sake discussion right now, just focus study
talks specific tools way used study. title
paper essentially summarizing called open monitoring meditation reduces
involvement brain regions related memory function. Now, right off bat
will cue something interesting. Something divergent thinking open
monitoring related suppressing memory. recall, just moments ago,
said order engage divergent thinking, need kill off narratives

possibilities start thinking possibilities be.
turns involves suppression certain brain areas. Open monitoring meditation
typically done 10 30 minutes although longer. unlike
forms meditation sit concentrate breathing trying
redirect thinking back breathing posture chant mantra,
open monitoring meditation simply matter sit lie close
eyes allow whatever surfaces mind surface. practice
practice nonjudgment. Now, nonjudgment little bit abstract theme
because, course, moment say don't judge others start judge.
just way brain works. say, don't think elephant think

certain amount time close eyes whatever thoughts arise,
whatever emotions arise, whatever ideas arise watch take inventory
just merely watch show pass maybe become fixated

words, whatever surfaces surfaces. open monitoring meditation.
know brain imaging studies know measurements dopamine,
particular brain circuits know people train open monitoring


meditation regular basis improves divergent thinking capability. terms tools,
practicing open monitoring meditation just call open monitoring thinking
going immensely useful. actually opportunity queue
something mentioned episode meditation, goes deep
different meditation involving focus inward outward, et cetera. welcome
check episode. hubermanlab.com. point rather think
word meditation, carries bunch ideas
isn't it, meditation really just perceptual exercise. instance,
meditation look single point wall five minutes
redirect focus single point wall every time
mind drifts no doubt would. tone room. attend
redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly
better divergent thinking. dopamine circuits
particular, along nigrostriatal pathway becoming active. wonderful
thing repeat practice particular neural circuit engaged
deliberately, neural circuit becomes easier engage. So-called
neuroplasticity. encourage want explore creative
process whatever reason get better creative process, dedicate amount
time. Maybe even just five minutes every day open monitoring
meditation. tried meditation.

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even
eyes open stare point wall flame light. Whatever happens
allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent

However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already

makes sense motivation, desire, movement linked
common, case neuromodulator chemical like dopamine. throughout
evolution excited motivated pursue something, move
order get it, obtain it. general, can frame dopamine umbrella
dopamine tends involved neural circuits brain involved
processes taking us beyond confines skin. is, motivate us
go something terms action world. Now, statement might seem
distantly placed discussion creativity, learn little bit later, one
useful tools engaging creativity becoming creative think
action elements within narrative. is, things others can
order discover new rules actual movement. little bit cryptic. Forgive
me. promise return later will make crystal clear. four major
circuits brain use dopamine. Although mention, additional
circuits well. fact, eye even contains neurons release dopamine
control sensitivity eye different times day light, et cetera. four
major circuits brain utilize dopamine however, used four major
purposes. describe are. First neural circuit uses
dopamine among things certainly relies dopamine critical way
engage movement, including eye movements. will return eye movement
important understanding creativity maybe even generating
creativity little bit later. name circuit, again, less important
does. name circuit want know so-called nigrostriatal
pathway. substantia nigra brain area dark projects area
called dorsal striatum. contains bunch subregions. So, again,
really geek stuff great, can learn names retain
memory. don't care names, don't worry it, just discard
names. areas brain like caudate putamen dorsal striatum
receive input substantia nigra. neuroanatomy, name something,
say origin thing connects through. nigrostriatal tells
connection substantia nigra came first, nigrostriatal,
striatal ends up. nigrostriatal pathway involved generating
bodily movements. involved eye movements. actually brain area


engaged think movement. can just story mind
walking story mind running story mind driving.
area engaged. interesting brain area. first circuit. important
understand. tell right now, brain circuit engaged
undergo divergent thinking. Now, interesting. Even don't
remember names things just told you, brain circuit
even just think walking becomes active. dopamine
involved brain activity. recall, divergent thinking involves taking
concept boring pen thinking concepts link
pen way, logical illogical. bridge completely abstract really
fantastical bunch different ideas between. pen acting doorstop
situation need run stairs fire get back
upstairs quickly rescue somebody, divergent. divergent black pen red
pen. amazing circuit one involved generating
thinking physical movement. turns vitally important tapping
creativity process. really frame mind commit memory.
Now, second dopamine circuit associated creativity one associated
convergent thinking, which, again, thinking specific correct answer.
requires focus requires persistence. name circuit, again,
name isn't important does. name circuit mesocortical
pathway. mesocortical pathway involved motivation emotional
component too. Now, will become clear minutes emotional
component vital. circuit originates brain structure called
lateral ventral tegmental area. Again, bunch words can remember want,
lateral ventral tegmental area can not worry name. connects
prefrontal cortex, area just behind forehead. mesocortical area
involved motivation emotion critical focus persistence. distinct
nearby area, just sitting right next door so-called mesolimbic area,
involved desire feelings reward. area associated
typically addictive behaviors compulsive behaviors. going leave
discussion mesolimbic pathway now not critical divergent
convergent thinking not critical process creativity least far
know. mention third four dopaminergic circuits.
fourth circuit certainly one never talked podcast,


doesn't mean anything except haven't gotten yet, tuberoinfundibular
pathway. pathway associated dopamine pituitary gland
release hormones, particular travel ovary. ovaries
testes testes trigger release things like estrogen
testosterone, et cetera. Dopamine intimately involved circuitry. Again, not
topic today's discussion. today's discussion, want remember
dopamine circuit called nigrostriatal circuit, involved movement
divergent thinking. alone set flag like wow, just thinking
new ideas something physical movement. dopamine circuit
mesocortical pathway, one associated motivation
emotion, one required persistence focus convergent thinking.
telling dopamine? Well, turns dopamine creates
certain number responses brain body active one
circuits. just sake simplicity, don't keep saying
nigrostriatal mesocortical. going forward, going talk dopamine
circuit associated divergent thinking dopamine circuit associated
convergent thinking. And, again, divergent thinking convergent think two
processes occur. Usually first divergent convergent thinking back
forth back forth order arrive something creative. Divergent thinking

Nature nurture something can never really teased apart exactly because,
course, someone natural proclivity something based genes,

not disparaging literature although rarely define exactly
go creative case divergent

actually that? Well, wonderful paper talks one way
it. One way called open monitoring meditation even just open
monitoring thinking. just make otherwise somewhat complex
section simple. also tell want enhance convergent
thinking, can number ways, can particular
different type meditation thought process, called focused attention
meditation. talk open monitoring meditation useful
enhancing divergent thinking, critical element creative process. First all,


open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus
position, doesn't really matter, lying down, standing up.
theory open monitoring meditation eyes open interesting
variant it. sake discussion right now, just focus study
talks specific tools way used study. title
paper essentially summarizing called open monitoring meditation reduces
involvement brain regions related memory function. Now, right off bat
will cue something interesting. Something divergent thinking open
monitoring related suppressing memory. recall, just moments ago,
said order engage divergent thinking, need kill off narratives
related come new narratives. still need
understand possibilities need forget prior understanding
possibilities start thinking possibilities be.
turns involves suppression certain brain areas. Open monitoring meditation
typically done 10 30 minutes although longer. unlike
forms meditation sit concentrate breathing trying
redirect thinking back breathing posture chant mantra,
open monitoring meditation simply matter sit lie close

words, whatever surfaces surfaces. open monitoring meditation.
know brain imaging studies know measurements dopamine,
particular brain circuits know people train open monitoring


meditation regular basis improves divergent thinking capability. terms tools,
practicing open monitoring meditation just call open monitoring thinking
going immensely useful. actually opportunity queue
something mentioned episode meditation, goes deep
different meditation involving focus inward outward, et cetera. welcome
check episode. hubermanlab.com. point rather think
word meditation, carries bunch ideas
isn't it, meditation really just perceptual exercise. instance,
meditation look single point wall five minutes
redirect focus single point wall every time
mind drifts no doubt would. tone room. attend
redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly
better divergent thinking. dopamine circuits
particular, along nigrostriatal pathway becoming active. wonderful
thing repeat practice particular neural circuit engaged
deliberately, neural circuit becomes easier engage. So-called
neuroplasticity. encourage want explore creative
process whatever reason get better creative process, dedicate amount
time. Maybe even just five minutes every day open monitoring
meditation. tried meditation.

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even
eyes open stare point wall flame light. Whatever happens
allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus
outside. Again, music, exercise, excellent way elevate
dopamine. talk another well-established one research literature
known elevate dopamine 65% particular pathway relevant divergent
thinking without pharmacology. share moment.
need decide given moment given work attempt creativity
need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk
little bit means three step process just little bit.
strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages
dosages caffeine safe fact, performance enhancing covered

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit
context dopamine. First all, no supplement drug
anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.
take pill even inject substance, again, hope legal
safe, et cetera. Whatever mode delivery, no technology exists
time allow selectively amplify dopamine. instance, just
nigrostriatal pathway just means mesocortical pathway. Again,
nigrostriatal pathway associated diversion thinking, music mesocortical pathway
associated cognitive persistence convergent thinking. amplify
dopamine levels, instance, taking amino acid precursor dopamine L-
Tyrosine, something occasionally enhance dopamine levels sake work

combine things like Alpha-GPC. going enhance dopamine
transmission nigrostriatal pathway, mesocortical pathway, also
mesolimbic pathway, also, matter tuberoinfundibular pathway
associated pituitary. no way direct dopamine activation just one
pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress
psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera, reduce dopamine.
people oftentimes will problems movement. will express
called clinical literature tardive dyskinesia. Writhing face body
suppression dopamine within nigrostriatal pathway, associated

actually selective deficits dopamine within substantia nigra.
Nigrostriatal, remember, substantia nigra show deficits what? movement.
smoothness movement. Oftentimes won't blink all. blank stare.
issues well. somebody interested
increasing dopamine use legal safe pharmacology hope
case, ways that, reasonably safely people. Again,
people bipolar disorder issues, dopaminergic pathway not this.

open monitoring meditation focused attention meditation can performed exact
way physically. can sit there, eyes closed, don't care Lotus

redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine

However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already

redirect that. Rather think meditation, really just perceptual
exercise. meditation is. open monitoring meditation really just form
perception paying attention, perceiving thoughts without
laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open
monitoring meditation. fortunately, within just days certainly within
week practice doesn't even daily practice. although,
course, daily practice will accelerate process further, people become significantly

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing
either breath, element body. tops knees
clasp hands. focusing auditory tone, even
eyes open stare point wall flame light. Whatever happens
allows redirect focus particular location idea sound.
known improve ability engage convergent thinking, quickly parse
analyze bunch different choices, persist choice selection therefore
rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,
determine feel one moment dictate tool use order
become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus
outside. Again, music, exercise, excellent way elevate
dopamine. talk another well-established one research literature
known elevate dopamine 65% particular pathway relevant divergent
thinking without pharmacology. share moment.
need decide given moment given work attempt creativity
need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk
little bit means three step process just little bit.
strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages
dosages caffeine safe fact, performance enhancing covered

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit

anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.
take pill even inject substance, again, hope legal

time allow selectively amplify dopamine. instance, just
nigrostriatal pathway just means mesocortical pathway. Again,

pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress

laying judgment thoughts trying not lay judgment thoughts.
people find quickly within days get better open

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think
just perceptual exercise involves sitting lying down, closing eyes, focusing

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent

However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking

actually quite fun least feels lot easier meditation
associated convergent thinking. Now, convergent thinking meditation so-
called focus attention meditation. also described study.
studies explored particular brain networks involves. can just tell


focused attention meditation, can think prefer think

rapidly arrive correct answer. well-established and, fact, in,
episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus
outside. Again, music, exercise, excellent way elevate
dopamine. talk another well-established one research literature
known elevate dopamine 65% particular pathway relevant divergent
thinking without pharmacology. share moment.
need decide given moment given work attempt creativity
need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk
little bit means three step process just little bit.
strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages
dosages caffeine safe fact, performance enhancing covered
episode caffeine turns 1 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight,
way. want leverage caffeine maybe even forms healthy legal
stimulants, covered caffeine episode. talk
little bit later. summarize segment also just make general point,
think useful people start pay attention tonic level,

happen in. leverage tools. Behavioral tools, maybe pharmacologic
tools provided safe legal order either increase dopamine

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit
context dopamine. First all, no supplement drug
anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.
take pill even inject substance, again, hope legal
safe, et cetera. Whatever mode delivery, no technology exists
time allow selectively amplify dopamine. instance, just
nigrostriatal pathway just means mesocortical pathway. Again,
nigrostriatal pathway associated diversion thinking, music mesocortical pathway
associated cognitive persistence convergent thinking. amplify
dopamine levels, instance, taking amino acid precursor dopamine L-
Tyrosine, something occasionally enhance dopamine levels sake work
energy, 500 milligrams 1,000 milligrams even L-Tyrosine. Sometimes
combine things like Alpha-GPC. going enhance dopamine
transmission nigrostriatal pathway, mesocortical pathway, also
mesolimbic pathway, also, matter tuberoinfundibular pathway
associated pituitary. no way direct dopamine activation just one
pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress
psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera, reduce dopamine.
people oftentimes will problems movement. will express
called clinical literature tardive dyskinesia. Writhing face body
suppression dopamine within nigrostriatal pathway, associated
movement. will sometimes deficits eye blinking. People Parkinson's
actually selective deficits dopamine within substantia nigra.
Nigrostriatal, remember, substantia nigra show deficits what? movement.
smoothness movement. Oftentimes won't blink all. blank stare.
issues well. somebody interested
increasing dopamine use legal safe pharmacology hope
case, ways that, reasonably safely people. Again,
people bipolar disorder issues, dopaminergic pathway not this.


know nowadays lot use drugs increase dopamine Ritalin,
Adderall, modafinil, armodafinil, often prescribed things like attention deficit

something drugs particular increase dopamine so-called mesocortical

confidence? Well, four pathways ones involved movement,
ones involved motivation desire reward. told
things can habit forming addicting cases can greatly
increase focus. focus supported enhanced levels dopamine within

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine

episode wonderful guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki New York University
talked daily meditation 10 13 minutes performed eight
weeks. explore. study greatly increases people's ability
focus fact, memory. exactly point, convergent
thinking mentioned before, requires persistence, focus, access specific
memories. somebody wants get better focusing,
meditation you. However, today talking creativity,
somebody wants get better divergent thinking convergent thinking, two
elements creativity. is, encourage dual meditation. is,
meditation starts open monitoring maybe 5 10 minutes
transitions focused attention maybe 5 10 minutes. positioning
divergent thinking convergent thinking close together, closely resembles
creative process really typically involves. us love
situation can spend morning day week brainstorming. Just
brainstorming. Whatever think fine. divergent thinking. Whatever
elements just throw whiteboard. sometimes see people
companies retreats. bring people novel environment. say,
just forget rules just come new ideas something. New
uses something, new strategies. nothing crazy. Nothing off limits.
sure, useful exercise so-called brainstorming. point,
requirement cross off things. typically done later retreat later
meeting later weekend. wonderful way approach creativity
try creative. not lot people train regular basis. just
described research tested tools training divergent thinking
convergent thinking. encourage people interested


creative try somewhat regular basis. not every day certainly
times week more. Certainly it, better going get
it. well demonstrated literature. somebody
consistent maybe five minutes open monitoring meditation five minutes
immediately focus attention meditation daily, can expect

01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine

will get very, good processes very, quickly. Now, not going go
lengthy description different lines evidence corresponding areas
brain active different . Meditation can tell
beautiful called loss function studies particular
brain areas either depleted dopamine dopamine cases guess
call gain function studies although not gain function studies
associated virology different gain function studies enhance level
dopamine brain. find divergent convergent thinking
enhanced levels dopamine elevated. Now, not necessarily talking
pharmacology here. turns ways elevate dopamine
make us better divergent convergent thinking particular, using mood.
now like talk mood happen start creative
process, try training open monitoring meditation focused
meditation. mood relates level dopamine baseline. call
tonic called, meaning consistent ongoing level dopamine,
dictates whether not going better one particular aspect creative
process another can enhance creativity short term,
quickly using tools known trigger additional release dopamine,
cases good cases bad, mention. words,

become creative. relationship mood creativity fascinating
one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high

anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.

rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress

one bridged one main feature, amount dopamine present
nigrostriatal pathway. really wonderful correlate measure amount
dopamine active pathway can addressed noninvasively
laboratory. mentioned, nigrostriatal pathway involved movement eye
blinking which, course, movement. not movement sort typically


think think movements, nonetheless relies dopamine levels
pathway. fact, can state confidently dopamine levels
elevated, blinking reflex active. People just blink more. dopamine
levels lower less active pathway, people tend blink less. blink
frequency common measure studies dopamine within pathway relate
creativity. work describe largely work two authors
done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, names
difficult pronounce. apologize relatives sure
incorrect pronunciation. last names authors Chermahini
Hommel. Netherlands. Chermahini Hommel done number
different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,
creativity particular, divergent thinking. found people blinking
fairly often measure mood subjective tests
brain imaging, studies done, find people can engage
divergent thinking easily. words, good mood facilitates
divergent thinking. Now, might immediately say, well, duh,
good mood can playful exploration happen
notes music foods, et cetera. not obvious. turns
dopamine levels very, high, can measured
noninvasively frequency blinks can measured invasively
brain imaging even blood draws methods measure
dopamine. dopamine levels very, high, observe divergent
thinking actually very, poor. Now, naturally occurring truly pathological example,
something like manic bipolar disorder somebody manic
phase somebody taken methamphetamine cocaine, tends happen
lots lots ideas, ideas seem really exciting them.
talk given moment, fixated one
particular tunnel ideas. fixated one particular tunnel ideas like
idea going run president tomorrow, unfortunately typical
people bipolar, not say everybody runs president
bipolar rather people bipolar often delusions grandeur
somehow going president simply decided
selected this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas people
constrained. words, not divergent.



01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology
increase dopamine. probably limiting amount external stimuli
coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not
mood is-- suppose spin three categories kind of-- yes, happy,
excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent
thinking process. case, also encourage think something
discussed previous episode, particular effects caffeine.
get caffeine little bit later. just briefly, caffeine increases levels
dopamine receptors. not caffeine bad. fact, caffeine can
neuroprotective, can enhance focus forth. divergent thinking anti focus.
requires just enough focus able come new ideas. actually don't
want overly focused. Focus conducive convergent thinking. fact,
exactly literature shows, caffeine effects epinephrine
related systems brain like adenosine. mainly effects
persistence focus conducive convergent thinking. somebody
wants explore creativity wants get better creativity, now know
need engage divergent thinking afterwards convergent thinking.
recommend not using stimulants caffeine prior divergent thinking
rather use stimulants want use stimulants caffeine prior
convergent thinking. fact, formulating architecture today's episode,
took many hours across many different days confess, actually decided try this.
trying imagine different configurations ways information can
organized, deliberately abstained caffeine bouts work.
structuring everything according decisions already made, purposely
ingested caffeine prior that. Now, course, constructing podcast episode not
really ultimate example creative act because, course, taking existing
information. arranging novel ways. doesn't necessarily allow key concepts
pop way that, instance, Banksy Rothko Escher pop out.
certainly not naive thinking does. principle important
here. need divergent thinking. need convergent thinking. need level
elevated dopamine order engage divergent thinking. not high
starts inhibit process. Now, come laboratory,
measured frequency blinking. better worse, can't actually count
number times blink unless actively paying attention it. don't
recommend pay attention blinking will take off course
important things life. many times blinking


rarely important thing pay attention to. can however, learn calibrate
mood is, assess mood whether not low, medium, high
mood. No problem using broad binning. scale 1 10.
decide whether not going use dopamine elevating stimulus

dopamine. talk another well-established one research literature
known elevate dopamine 65% particular pathway relevant divergent

need decide given moment given work attempt creativity
need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk

strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages
dosages caffeine safe fact, performance enhancing covered

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit
context dopamine. First all, no supplement drug
anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.
take pill even inject substance, again, hope legal
safe, et cetera. Whatever mode delivery, no technology exists
time allow selectively amplify dopamine. instance, just
nigrostriatal pathway just means mesocortical pathway. Again,
nigrostriatal pathway associated diversion thinking, music mesocortical pathway
associated cognitive persistence convergent thinking. amplify
dopamine levels, instance, taking amino acid precursor dopamine L-
Tyrosine, something occasionally enhance dopamine levels sake work

associated pituitary. no way direct dopamine activation just one
pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress
psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera, reduce dopamine.
people oftentimes will problems movement. will express

different papers studies rather relationship blinking, mood,

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology

01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine

divergent thinking favored elevated levels dopamine not high.
Well, that, course, creates conundrum. know much dopamine
need achieve elevated levels dopamine. Well, leaving aside people
suffering manic episode Chermahini Hommel discovered
people low mood, not feeling great, maybe depressed
just not feeling great. feel scale 1 10, around 2, 3,
maybe 4. probability will able engage effectively divergent
thinking quite low. However, good news is, typically susceptible
elevations mood observing hearing positive stories, listening music
like, kind so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, good news.
means somebody not feeling motivated engage divergent
thinking, not feeling creative, feeling little low. thing
case actually take external stimuli. Things like start interacting
stimuli get mood elevated engage divergent thinking.
However, Chermahini Hommel also shown people already
good mood, elevating dopamine not conducive. fact,
detrimental divergent thinking. case, better off example,
not engaging activities taking anything way pharmacology

coming music visual stimuli really focusing divergent thinking
creative process immediately. Now, important. earlier episode
bipolar forms depression, talked rates bipolar manic
episodes dopamine levels creativity tend correlated. Now, unfortunately,
rates suicide 20 30 times higher people bipolar disorder well.
whole dark side bipolar disorder makes very,
dangerous important disorder treat. sake discussion creativity,
means need develop intuitive sense whether not

excited, positive mood, and, course, going levels that. Low like,
mmmh, meh middle. low mood meh mood, means
engage something probably 5 30 minutes elevates mood


trying engage divergent thinking. However, happen pretty positive
mood, even not 10 10 mood, bringing additional stimuli
increase levels dopamine will not help fact can hurt divergent

trying imagine different configurations ways information can

need apply accordingly. Chermahini Hommel
shown, whether not low mood, medium mood, high mood, really can
determine whether not able access divergent thinking not. Now,
somebody already idea mind, excited creative idea
want hone it, want shape it, want pressure test it. talk
little bit means three step process just little bit.
strongly encourage look process linear process
right wrong answers. there, use caffeine appropriate dosages

tools provided safe legal order either increase dopamine

01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine

elect not increase dopamine order access creative process. Now,
mentioned pharmacology times. like talk just little bit
context dopamine. First all, no supplement drug
anyone else can take will selectively elevate dopamine one four


circuits described before. just state technology nowadays.
take pill even inject substance, again, hope legal

time allow selectively amplify dopamine. instance, just
nigrostriatal pathway just means mesocortical pathway. Again,
nigrostriatal pathway associated diversion thinking, music mesocortical pathway

combine things like Alpha-GPC. going enhance dopamine
transmission nigrostriatal pathway, mesocortical pathway, also
mesolimbic pathway, also, matter tuberoinfundibular pathway
associated pituitary. no way direct dopamine activation just one
pathways. just reflection existing technology. Now, also true
rely illicit drugs increase dopamine. cocaine methamphetamine,
will greatly increase dopamine nonselectively across different
pathways. likewise drugs inhibit block antagonize called
dopamine. people who, instance, schizophrenia take drugs
suppress auditory hallucinations, drugs work block so-
called D2 receptor dopamine pathway. D2 receptors present four
dopaminergic pathways brain. oftentimes, drugs will fact suppress
psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations, et cetera, reduce dopamine.
people oftentimes will problems movement. will express

things can habit forming addicting cases can greatly
increase focus. focus supported enhanced levels dopamine within
mesolimbic mesocortical pathway. yes, drugs increase dopamine across

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent

broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin

always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools

behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking

again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol

divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated

important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes
closed allowing mind drift, wherever happens go, focusing relaxing
long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively
motionless really favors brain states associated divergent thinking. actually
represents accessing various components use divergent

increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent

although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study

excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,

depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase

increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,

always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,

microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch

neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase

effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related

speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative

turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read

moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance

brain dopamine changed levels before, during, particular
behavioral practice one group. discovered people
deep relaxation, is, self-directed deep relaxation lying eyes closed,
relatively motionless although small movements body movements head
absolutely fine. observed 65% increase dopamine release. Now,
key. Dopamine release. observed increase so-called theta
activity. Theta activity pattern brain wave activity commonly associated
creative states divergent thinking particular. important. observe
across subjects specifically nigrostriatal pathway. pathway associated
divergent thinking. exciting. study really points
behavioral tool can used selectively elevate dopamine pathway
one want wanted engage divergent thinking sake creative
exploration. also number key observations within study. First all,
reduction bodily movement essential. fact, people rated
amount readiness action system, body evaluated. people
found immediately practice felt still. words, felt
remaining still natural. Now not case couldn't move. fact,
elevation dopamine occurred practice, yoga nidra-like nonsleep
NSDR-like practice, actually prepared able move much
dedicated robust way afterwards. practice, readiness action
went way, way down. Not surprising. pretty much motionless.
interestingly, level readiness movement went down, down, down,
down, degree visual imagery, is, internal landscape ability
imagine new things increased. fact, areas brain associated
visual imagery visual so-called occipital cortex parietal cortex
shown studies ramp people motionless. seems
inverse relationship movement visual imagery makes sense.
moving can pay attention things outside world, tend
aware sensory environment varying degrees. don't tend
focused visual imagery within head whereas lie sit
close eyes motionless, degree visual imagery really increases.
Hence, increase divergent thinking essentially happening


library options, library possible interactions whatever
thinking about. gave example, trivial one purpose pen.
bank options becomes available motionless
limiting visualization external world increases exponentially.
important. points fact simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral practice lying motionless period time.
confess amount time use study quite long. longer
60 minutes. data aware terms NSDR yoga nidra,
growing body literature practices mention, show even
10 minutes even better 20 30 minutes lying motionless eyes
closed allowing mind drift, wherever happens go, focusing relaxing
long exhale breathing, perhaps body scan focusing attention
particular body parts not keeping focused one particular body part
long, general practice deep relaxation awake relatively

represents accessing various components use divergent
thinking. perhaps excitingly, associated massive increase, 65%
increase dopamine release within pathway underlies divergent thinking.
recommendation trying enhance divergent
thinking creative ability, practice minimum per

20 30 minutes. might able long 60
minutes. practice daily basis, anywhere 10 minutes 20
minutes, sometimes 30 minutes. example NSDR script, completely zero

deep relaxation. Again, happen fall asleep, not necessarily bad thing,


although idea stay shallow plane consciousness sleep hence
term nonsleep deep rest. event, think useful practice
many people benefit from. fact zero cost purely behavioral,
think adds additional benefit certainly one people explore
depending amount time willing commit. research data
now extend beyond one individual paper. think really exciting
says title first line paper suggests can increase
dopamine using specific types meditation induced consciousness.
increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets
dopaminergic tone. actually appropriate use word dopaminergic
tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR
practice. not necessarily immediately within 5 15 minutes following,
go practice divergent thinking start creative exploration.
start thinking different ways combine existing elements whatever domain
want achieve creativity. point divergent thinking
not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target
effects. interested increasing creativity
pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018

changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis

excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,

increases dopamine can used increase ability creative.
moving forward, want make absolutely clear use NSDR
a.k.a. yoga nidra similar, name doesn't really matter all, practice
matters, order enhance dopamine nigrostriatal pathway enhance
divergent thinking. key thing understand period motionlessness
deep relaxation awake increases dopamine nigrostriatal pathway.
increases mental imagery. is, increases access bank library,
will, possible solutions elements engage divergent thinking process.
divergent thinking not occur NSDR a.k.a. yoga nidra. NSDR
yoga nidra, deep relaxation meditation, whatever want call it, sets

tone raises baseline dopamine transmission circuitry positions
engage divergent thinking effectively. idea
anywhere 10 20, maybe 30 minutes, maybe even much hour,
depending much time dedicate meditation NSDR

not occurring NSDR yoga nidra practice.

01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking

NSDR yoga nidra practice prepares divergent thinking
hour hours follows. just contrast pharmacology, not aware
specific dopamine related pharmacology allow us selectively increase


dopamine pathway associated divergent thinking creativity. Now,
forms pharmacology can shift brain neurotransmitters modulators
ways favor creativity. certainly topic go depth
future episode. exciting study performed just last year
looking role serotonin, another neuromodulator, divergent convergent
thinking. turns serotonin underlies lot brain activity
responsible divergent convergent thinking. one particular
form pharmacology can enhance activation serotonergic pathways
associated so-called 5-HT, serotonin. 5-HT, abbreviation. 5-
HT2A receptor. Serotonin 2A receptor particular brain areas ways favor
divergent convergent thinking. pharmacologic agent case turns
low dose may heard referred microdosing
psilocybin. Now, want say entirely inappropriate not
say this, areas world particularly United States, psilocybin
still illegal. not legal. areas decriminalized
number different clinical trials occurring now Johns Hopkins, Stanford,
University California, San Francisco, elsewhere exploring psilocybin
treatment depression, trauma, eating disorders. studies focus
macrodoses psilocybin not microdosing. far fewer studies microdosing
psilocybin. point psilocybin use possession and, course,
sale still illegal. remiss didn't state that. However, will provide link
study shows microdosing psilocybin series weeks daily
basis. dosages psilocybin not induce hallucination not
massively shift mood internal states way people feeling like
acting feeling much different although people report subjective shift.
seem increase divergent thinking ability. want put big asterisks,
highlight underlying beneath statement make,
pharmacology serotonin system just pharmacology dopamine system
broadband. shotgun approach. going hit circuits brain
involve serotonin microdosing psilocybin. Although selectivity
5-HT2A receptor can attach receptors well act there.
reason SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors can indeed shift mood
appetite can also shift libido things. serotonin
receptors everywhere, say many places, not just areas brain


associated mood, instance. mentioned before, agents, whether
not recreational illicit drugs prescription drugs supplements
increase dopamine will also broadband number different circuits parallel.
always say behavioral tools really come first. don't say
dislike pharmacology, say many cases behavioral tools
not safer easier titrate adjust duration, et cetera pharmacology,
also can sometimes case study just described
specificity not less pharmacology. Pharmacology place can
wonderful, provided safe legal, et cetera. can cause lot so-called off target

pharmacology, say, stay tuned data psilocybin microdosing
psilocybin. absolutely obsessed idea microdosing psilocybin
enhancing creativity like go straight study, will tell
study therefore can access specifics terms dosages
protocols, et cetera. since can't help myself, just briefly summarize
microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem
solving task, picture concept task, don't expect recognize know
assesses convergent thinking alternative uses task also don't expect
know standard task assessing divergent thinking. tested
taking microdose effects expected manifested
say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis



later and, again, provide link want read study
depth. can imagine number probably also wondering
effects alcohol effects cannabis creativity. long in-depth
episode alcohol effects health. bottom line alcohol
excess two drinks per week, starting run cancer promoting toxic
effects alcohol. didn't choose answer that, data tell
us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain
populations. also dove whether not cannabis can used increase
divergent convergent thinking. timestamped episode. refer

influence cannabis particular high THC containing cannabis
lead enhanced divergent thinking, enhanced turns oftentimes
ideas can't constrained convergent thinking process. words,
lots ideas make sense influence cannabis.
later cannot implemented coherent framework leads actual creative


endeavor creative product.

01:52:04 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity

Or, often case cannabis, simply can't remember
thinking about. time discussion dopamine, seems

01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate
ways. tells us direct maybe indirect relationship
movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.
treadmill back forth across room. fact,
absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.
state essentially not directing attention one thing external
environment, extremely key reasons now obvious. time
directing attention visual target auditory target not able
engage divergent thinking. will sometimes listen podcasts
audiobooks go runs. portions runs hikes tend turn
off just focus movement focus not focusing anything
particular. oftentimes will stop write ideas suddenly seemingly
suddenly appear geyser surface. idea. Sometimes
good ideas, sometimes less good ideas. fact happens fact
many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific
location either visual auditory, et cetera, engages nigrostriatal
pathways movement opens library ideas allows


intersection different ideas normally constrained separate categories.
One way think analogy kid go library,
nowadays just go online. different pages different books different
topics kept distinct one another. bound different book covers
book ends, different shelves library. different pages elements
books now combined pseudo random. Not random pseudo
random way. combination, new possibilities ways information
combined implemented start arise. tool emerges
simple. won't necessarily apply everybody. somebody
finds just sitting chair trying creative challenging,
might benefit from, instance, engaging writing want write talk
voice recorder phone walking simply walking not attending
one specific thing visually headphones. ideas surface,
seemingly nowhere, happens, either put
phone voice dictation type like. key thing
not distracted things phone, not start going onto social media
phone calls looking text messages definition going take
biologists call pseudo random walk. pseudo random
element extremely important. know, instance, many circuits within
brain called dedicated point point wiring. So, instance, brain
circuits govern breathing. brain circuits govern heartbeat.
brain circuits govern specific movements adult allow
smooth directed movement precise, little slop wiring. However,
aspects brain circuitry, everybody else's say,
maintained adulthood include lot extra wiring. fine wires.
not major highways different areas, will. like Google
Maps highways streets little passages alleys. little
web additional possible pathways cast entire thing. human brain
maintains webs possible passage. activities walking,
running, cycling, swimming, hiking, pacing, et cetera activation pseudo
random pathways starts ramp up. purely behavioral approach engaging
different elements within neural networks normally not communicate one
another completely still. again, practices talked earlier
completely still raise dopamine enhanced divergent thinking-- just want


reemphasize designed position ready engage activities like
walking pacing, et cetera, best facilitate divergent thinking.
somebody wants enhance divergent thinking, encourage explore
different patterns movement particular, patterns movement don't require
conscious attention one specific thing allow access new ideas new
ways combining existing elements whatever domain want creative.
Now, also opportunity underscore something said back beginning,
not going come great works music don't understand
chords melodies notes music. basic elements built
formal least rigorous regular training. way
not going take walk, suddenly able paint incredible picture
no painting ability. not going happen. talking
ways enhance capacity divergent thinking, NSDR ways

require lot conscious attention surroundings one specific sensory
target. so, enhancing ability

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.
number different aspects narrative theory. agree
standard definition creativity one talking before.
not talking different form creativity, talking different
way access creativity. describe standard definition creativity quote "The

us. not telling can't drink two drinks per week, just saying
going that, really consider offsetting
behavioral measures discussed episode alcohol. despite people
think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking
low doses. makes sense. Divergent thinking involves remembering certain
things can use elements creative process suppressing narratives
use mean. Will people like it? Will not like it? Will
outcome want? Well, won't. autobiographical scripting involves
forebrain very, active specific regions forebrain particular.
needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol

01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate
ways. tells us direct maybe indirect relationship
movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.

absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.
state essentially not directing attention one thing external

particular. oftentimes will stop write ideas suddenly seemingly
suddenly appear geyser surface. idea. Sometimes
good ideas, sometimes less good ideas. fact happens fact
many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific
location either visual auditory, et cetera, engages nigrostriatal
pathways movement opens library ideas allows


intersection different ideas normally constrained separate categories.
One way think analogy kid go library,
nowadays just go online. different pages different books different
topics kept distinct one another. bound different book covers
book ends, different shelves library. different pages elements
books now combined pseudo random. Not random pseudo
random way. combination, new possibilities ways information

simple. won't necessarily apply everybody. somebody
finds just sitting chair trying creative challenging,
might benefit from, instance, engaging writing want write talk

completely still raise dopamine enhanced divergent thinking-- just want


reemphasize designed position ready engage activities like
walking pacing, et cetera, best facilitate divergent thinking.
somebody wants enhance divergent thinking, encourage explore
different patterns movement particular, patterns movement don't require

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.
number different aspects narrative theory. agree
standard definition creativity one talking before.
not talking different form creativity, talking different

writing called Poetics, think incredible least people long us
thinking creativity goes creativity. Aristotle said,
Guilford elaborated authors paper elaborate
actually developed training protocols for, idea three elements
can use order enhance creativity. three elements
called world building, explain moment, perspective shifting,

interesting powerful step really captures least viewed
me, neuroscientists, captures whole set neural circuits
motivational state means motivational states dictate huge number possible
different outcomes, really constrain number different actions


outcomes us engage in. Rather saying going view world

here, story, create novel rule world story going exist
music going exist sport will exist in. create perspective

someone else entirely different motivation. so,
create called creative collisions. Now collisions

microdosing psychedelic study. title study, published 2018
Exploring Effect Microdosing Psychedelics Creativity Open Label Natural
Setting. Interesting title. microdosing event organized Dutch
psychedelic society. examined effects psychedelic truffles knew
psychedelic compounds contained two creativity related problem

know standard task assessing divergent thinking. tested
taking microdose effects expected manifested
say. Interesting. use word manifested study psychedelics. Science
changing indeed. case, found enhancement creative. is,
divergent convergent thinking not surprising given fact 5-HT2A receptor
activity increased microdosing psilocybin 5-HT2A receptors present
neural circuits underlie divergent convergent thinking. So, again,
not plug microdosing psilocybin. really response know will
number different questions pharmacologic agents can used increase
creativity.

think, absolutely zero evidence alcohol increases creativity. However,
way reducing activation prefrontal cortex, evidence alcohol
substances reduce called autobiographical scripting, is,
narrative ourselves, self awareness, can enhance divergent thinking

needs suppressed, alcohol low doses can accomplish. But,
again, not plug alcohol. think behavioral tools much better route.
therefore shouldn't surprising people used low dose alcohol
order engage creative process involves less inhibition sense
self detrimental divergent thinking process. Now, respect
cannabis, went depth biology various uses, misuses, dangers,
cases benefits cannabis use certain. key word certain

01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate

movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.
treadmill back forth across room. fact,
absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.
state essentially not directing attention one thing external

many people pacers runners come best ideas shower
engaging activities don't require lot sensory attention one specific

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even

exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related

speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.

interested creative process, focusing generally please check
episodes mentioned. Now, also small nonetheless exciting
literature relationship physical movement divergent thinking.
come no surprise us. mentioned many times now episode,
nigrostriatal pathway involved divergent thinking involves dopamine also
responsible eye blinks movements limbs body deliberate

movement body divergent thinking. despite fact
studies, studies whether not people able engage
divergent thinking effectively things like pacing walking.
treadmill back forth across room. fact,
absolutely case. somebody like tends best ideas,
not saying ideas always terrific, among ideas have,
better ones arrive long Sunday run. tend long run hike
Sundays sometimes light weight vest something sort.

02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling Creativity

creative domain already degree skill even
mastery. Now, keeping theme enhance creativity,
exciting yet parallel literature literature describing thus far. Now,
promise not going open entire library new information related
neural circuits forth. remiss didn't mention parallel literature
speaks specifically important practices can use
order enhance creativity. first time every time. really
certain scientists really gone trouble. even
say painstaking trouble really trying dissect creative process
individuals groups even pairs. tell beautifully
encapsulated article entitled-- "A new method training creativity-- narrative
alternative divergent thinking." again, talking divergent
thinking. one pathway creative process others well.
turns out, not distinct terms underlying brain mechanisms.
Nonetheless, let describe briefly narrative can used train creativity


become creative. order that, like just briefly paraphrase read
first paragraph paper. read author's words,
not mine. Quote "Here's paradox. According current research young children
imaginatively creative adults." indeed true, way. "Yet also
according current research, creativity main neural engine divergent thinking,
relies memory logical association tasks young children
underperform adults." is, children not good divergent thinking adults
are. authors asking children imaginative
thus creative adults. can mean alternate pathways
creativity. indeed case. paper really explores
ways access creativity. describe called narrative theory.
number different aspects narrative theory. agree
standard definition creativity one talking before.
not talking different form creativity, talking different
way access creativity. describe standard definition creativity quote "The
ability generate novel ideas useful." commonly accepted one.
cite basis narrative theory breakthrough finding 1950s.
work Guilford people might familiar it. not
outset researching episode. theory Guilford essentially states
different intellectual capacities not captured standard IQ
tests. think generally accepted nowadays. know emotional
intelligence, know standard IQ, et cetera. important element
understand authors able trace back idea narrative training
way enhance creativity long Guilford 1950s, way back
Aristotle. incredible. Narrative theory actually birthed 335 BCE
writing called Poetics, think incredible least people long us
thinking creativity goes creativity. Aristotle said,
Guilford elaborated authors paper elaborate
actually developed training protocols for, idea three elements
can use order enhance creativity. three elements
called world building, explain moment, perspective shifting,
action generating. right off bat, word action raise flag you.
mean positive flag again, back world
therefore neural circuits movement motion. three elements world


building perspective, shifting, active generating make narrative
approach creativity. mention authors others using
approach companies, groups, individuals. using bunch

sets certain number important constraints. means certain things now
possible, things not possible different world live
in. can see parallels childhood imagination essentially anything
can happen child's mind unconstrained. second element
perspective shifting techniques. idea not supposed
reader listener observer us explore creativity develop
creative idea thinking differently generic term. actually think
differently. rather just say take perspective somebody else terms
see say think rather, supposed think
underlying motivation. world shift, world structure shift
step one. step two, ask OK, rather write
think move perspective myself, say, feeling
particularly happy day. say, actually going take perspective
somebody angry. rather just act angry, going think
motivation angry is. Maybe breakup. Maybe jealous.
Maybe somebody wronged way. Maybe just generally angry
world whatever reason operate motivational stance.
interesting powerful step really captures least viewed
me, neuroscientists, captures whole set neural circuits
motivational state means motivational states dictate huge number possible
different outcomes, really constrain number different actions


outcomes us engage in. Rather saying going view world
way someone else will view world, stating going
motivated set motivations not own, includes lot possibilities
yet not infinite number possibilities. constrained logical way,
one key elements creativity. third element, action
generating techniques really cool one will immediately notice implications
workplace, forced collaboration. inside thing building
here, story, create novel rule world story going exist
music going exist sport will exist in. create perspective
shift take motivation someone else different
force collaboration person alternate motivation different
someone else entirely different motivation. so,
create called creative collisions. Now collisions
crossing one another something new emerge them.
antagonistic. arguments fighting physical verbal Otherwise
synergistic. take number different forms depending

creative, want think outside usual framework yet using elements
exist within us no one tell us creative narrative. trying come
