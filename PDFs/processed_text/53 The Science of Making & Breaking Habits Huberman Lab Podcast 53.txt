00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity

pretty confident will. Again, helixsleep.com/huberman find
Helix mattress you. talk habits. anytime talking
habits, means nervous system learns something. Now, many people think
habits just like reflexes, pure reflexes things like eye blink reflex.
know, something comes towards eye don't want get eye,
blink. happen step sharp object, get close something
hot, reflexively move away. aren't habits. call hard-wired
reflexes. Habits things nervous system learned, not always consciously.
Sometimes develop habits not even aware become problem
maybe serve us well. knows? fact matter habits
big part are. habitually makes much entirely.
fact, estimated 70% waking behavior made habitual
behavior. So, can imagine lot biology, meaning cells hormones
neural pathways, et cetera, going support development habits.
habits largely, learned, consciously unconsciously, ask
ourselves, learning? Well, learning neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity simply
process nervous system changes response experience.
ask, changes? Well, changes connections neurons. Neurons
just nerve cells. communicate one another electricity sending
chemical signals one another inspire next neuron next neuron
either electrically active not. end day, neuroplasticity forming
new neural circuits, new pathways certain habits likely occur,
ones less likely occur. So, got habits. habits learned,
learning involves neuroplasticity,



00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits

neuroplasticity involves changes connections neurons, nerve
cells. Okay, describes habits lens neuroscience biology,
many well aware, popular books habits whole
psychological literature habits, two areas point interesting
aspects habits think worth mentioning. First notion immediate
goal-based habits versus identity-based habits. Immediate goal-based habits going
habits designed bring specific outcome them,
every time them. instance, might want develop habit
getting, know, 60 minutes zone II cardio day, perhaps 3-4 times per
week, head new year. talked podcast fact
scientific literature health literature really points incredibly positive
effects getting 150 minutes 180 minutes per week minimum called zone II
cardio. Zone II cardio basically cardiovascular exercise gets moving,
heart pumping, breathing, not hard can't hold conversation,
kind puts threshold just just able
conversation little bit strained, exercise little bit harder,
know, run little bit faster, et cetera, wouldn't able talk it.
lot literature points healthy practice. maybe somebody
wants get zone II cardio, instance. immediate goal-
based habit goal get cardio, maybe 4 times week. Every time
check off little box say, "Okay, it." met goal. different
so-called identity-based habits larger, over-arching theme
habit, trying become, quote unquote, "a fit person". somebody
wants athlete something sort. start attach
sort larger picture means habit
immediate goal, right? Complete exercise, complete session,
whatever is, check off box. linking sort larger goal.
Now, making distinction? mean, first all, not one first make
distinction. Others made distinction identity versus immediate
goal-based habit formation. reason making distinction pretty soon
discussion today going talk dopamine, molecule


associated motivation reward, make brain, different
schedules dopamine release predict will stick habit not.
particular, whether not will able form habit quickly

00:11:40 Long (Really) Takes Form Habit; Limbic-Friction

not. Now, absolutely critical understand following reason. Another
thing hear literature takes 21 days form habit.
people say 18, people say 21, people say 30 days, people say
60 days. one it? depend habit one trying form?
depend person trying form habit? Well, turns
excellent peer-reviewed data this. study published 2010, first author
Lally, L L L Y. study found that, habit formed, can take
anywhere 18 days many 254 days different individuals form
habit. reason bring up, always get asked, "Is true takes 21
days form habit?" "Is true nervous system changes six days" "when
something repeatedly?" answer is, mentioned before, highly
variable. didn't tell actually, specific habit looking
Lally study. interesting specific behavior health-related behavior.
pretty relevant discussion here, podcast. taking walks
dinner. actually really nice literature showing walks meal can
speed glucose clearance blood stream, can beneficial not just weight
loss, cardiovascular health, et cetera. walk dinner seems pretty straight-
forward, right? Well, order form habit, took people 18 days
people 254 days. know formed habit? Well,
85% time also reported not spend much mental
effort order get mode taking walk dinner. So,
listening, might thinking, "I can't believe take certain people
254 days" "to get habit." said, people highly variable can't
form one habit easily, doesn't mean can't form habits easily.
mystery certain people can form certain habits easily others? Probably
something people manage called limbic friction. Now, limbic
friction not term going find formal neurobiological literature
even psychological literature. It's, frankly, term coined encompass


number different pieces psychology neuroscience literature. Limbic
friction short-hand way use describe strain required order
overcome one two states within body. One state one anxiousness,
really anxious therefore can't calm down, can't relax, therefore
can't engage particular activity thought pattern like.
state one feeling tired lazy not motivated.
states, feeling alert calm, will, relate function so-called
autonomic nervous system, set neurons hormones chemicals brain
body act sort see-saw. either alert calm. either asleep
stressed. two states not compatible one another. probably
heard "wired tired" really stressed long
time, point exhausted. autonomic nervous system
this? Well, limbic friction phrase can used describe
much effort, much activation energy need order engage particular
behavior. So, using Lally study example, people eat dinner,
say, "Oh, right, trying develop habit" "of taking walk
dinner." "So, get go." people will feel like, "I just don't want
today." going feel much limbic friction limbic friction arrive,
again, one two sources. tired
anxious distracted order it. So, key
distinction. lot habit formation right state mind
able control state body mind. march forward,
going find phrase term, limbic friction, going useful metric
way touch address whether not likely
able form certain habit easily whether not going challenging.
going teach way measure degree limbic friction. is,
much activation energy will take order execute new habit. going
teach measure limbic friction

00:16:07 Linchpin Habits

activation energy likely going able break habit
don't want have. key concept us address really mainly
found books articles habits, notions call


linchpin habits. Linchpin habits certain habits make lot habits easier
execute. Now, sorts linchpin habits referring always going
things enjoy doing. just give example life. happen like
exercise. Not forms exercise, happen like resistance training happen
like running. personally habit getting cardiovascular exercise 3 4
times per week. Maybe 30-60 minutes per session. habit
resistance training 3 4 times per week, typically also 45 60 minutes per
session. Now, enjoy those, reasons get little bit later, enjoy
activities typically early day neurochemistry various types
hormones, et cetera, associates performing activities. really
place activities umbrella call linchpin habits. Why?
particular habits easy execute enjoy them. also make
lot habits easier execute. Things like alert work, things like making
sure get good sleep night before, things like hydration, things like making sure
eat foods better foods maybe
reflexively reach weren't training. certain habits act
linchpins, meaning shift lot things. can control bias
likelihood that, case me, will perform habits harder access,
less affinity for. again, three concepts need
include here. got identity-based versus goal-based habits. got concept
typically different habits take different periods time adopt, depending
person habit. these, call linchpin habits. Certain habits
make habits easier execute. linchpin habits always, always,
always things enjoy doing. goal throughout episode
identify habits easy perform, ones hard perform,
habits want break. want grab pen paper, can
that. want dictate phone, can. right now,
actually, just want think concepts, can always go back later,
sure spell specific way can chart map towards forming
particular habits breaking particular habits later on. like us point
take concepts limbic friction

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,
things basic brushing teeth breakfast, brushing teeth
breakfast. be, instance, get exercise get particular time
day, even take particular route work, right? habitual
tend things less way, unless intervene
ourselves. just way wired. now like shift thinking
particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious
over-ride state required order engage particular behavior. So,
feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious
lot work deal bunch things, lot limbic
friction overcome order get calm state. two aspects, context
dependence, whether not like thing regardless are.
Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

00:22:55 Automaticity

will tell whether not habit deeply just shallowly embedded within
nervous system. goal habit want form get called
automaticity. Automaticity fancy language neural circuits can perform
automatically, ultimate place be. right, goals
things want regular basis, love habitual
takes less mental physical effort, less limbic friction, order execute
those. much there, popular psychology literature,
books find bookstore shelf Amazon, airports,
get mode high degree limbic friction automaticity.
offer number different ways, think many useful, trying get
organize different types habits different bins, like value-based, goal-based,
trying persuade structuring habits particular times day
particular way going beneficial, indeed, think helped lot
people. like take scientific literature nervous system
learns engages plasticity, apply habit formation,



00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum

just way described trying initiate new habit. now like discuss
second, think perhaps powerful tool able acquire

saying, "Just tell do." say, always say,
understanding little bit lot underlying mechanism will help solidify

like access podcasts can find menu podcasts
YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. involve, instance, viewing sunlight bright
artificial light can't access sunlight, within first 30 minutes waking. Physical
exercise kind phase day, 0 8 hours day, ideally pretty
early phase, but, know, 7 8 hour transition point
fine too. Cold exposure form cold showers ice baths outside minimal

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing

anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really

receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise

tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps

be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then

broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel

quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage

effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not

trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock

engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch

kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

designed specifically basis neurobiology literature literature
psychology habit formation habit breaking. Just briefly recap, one
program involves dividing 24 hour day three phases, phase one, phase two,
phase three, try tackle specific habits particular phases 24 hour
cycle. second program involved 21 day process engaging approximately 6 new
habits per day, although expectation, mentioned earlier, not going
perform 6 those. assessment following 21 days whether
not indeed formed new habits not. number
features mentioned related two general programs. Phase one,
phase two, phase three, 21 day program, meshed
together. So, guessing will probably questions

00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity

pretty confident will. Again, helixsleep.com/huberman find
Helix mattress you. talk habits. anytime talking
habits, means nervous system learns something. Now, many people think
habits just like reflexes, pure reflexes things like eye blink reflex.
know, something comes towards eye don't want get eye,
blink. happen step sharp object, get close something
hot, reflexively move away. aren't habits. call hard-wired
reflexes. Habits things nervous system learned, not always consciously.
Sometimes develop habits not even aware become problem
maybe serve us well. knows? fact matter habits
big part are. habitually makes much entirely.
fact, estimated 70% waking behavior made habitual
behavior. So, can imagine lot biology, meaning cells hormones
neural pathways, et cetera, going support development habits.
habits largely, learned, consciously unconsciously, ask
ourselves, learning? Well, learning neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity simply
process nervous system changes response experience.
ask, changes? Well, changes connections neurons. Neurons
just nerve cells. communicate one another electricity sending
chemical signals one another inspire next neuron next neuron
either electrically active not. end day, neuroplasticity forming
new neural circuits, new pathways certain habits likely occur,
ones less likely occur. So, got habits. habits learned,
learning involves neuroplasticity,



00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits

neuroplasticity involves changes connections neurons, nerve
cells. Okay, describes habits lens neuroscience biology,
many well aware, popular books habits whole
psychological literature habits, two areas point interesting
aspects habits think worth mentioning. First notion immediate
goal-based habits versus identity-based habits. Immediate goal-based habits going
habits designed bring specific outcome them,
every time them. instance, might want develop habit
getting, know, 60 minutes zone II cardio day, perhaps 3-4 times per
week, head new year. talked podcast fact
scientific literature health literature really points incredibly positive
effects getting 150 minutes 180 minutes per week minimum called zone II
cardio. Zone II cardio basically cardiovascular exercise gets moving,
heart pumping, breathing, not hard can't hold conversation,
kind puts threshold just just able
conversation little bit strained, exercise little bit harder,
know, run little bit faster, et cetera, wouldn't able talk it.
lot literature points healthy practice. maybe somebody
wants get zone II cardio, instance. immediate goal-
based habit goal get cardio, maybe 4 times week. Every time
check off little box say, "Okay, it." met goal. different
so-called identity-based habits larger, over-arching theme
habit, trying become, quote unquote, "a fit person". somebody
wants athlete something sort. start attach
sort larger picture means habit
immediate goal, right? Complete exercise, complete session,
whatever is, check off box. linking sort larger goal.
Now, making distinction? mean, first all, not one first make
distinction. Others made distinction identity versus immediate
goal-based habit formation. reason making distinction pretty soon
discussion today going talk dopamine, molecule


associated motivation reward, make brain, different
schedules dopamine release predict will stick habit not.
particular, whether not will able form habit quickly

00:11:40 Long (Really) Takes Form Habit; Limbic-Friction

not. Now, absolutely critical understand following reason. Another
thing hear literature takes 21 days form habit.
people say 18, people say 21, people say 30 days, people say
60 days. one it? depend habit one trying form?
depend person trying form habit? Well, turns
excellent peer-reviewed data this. study published 2010, first author
Lally, L L L Y. study found that, habit formed, can take
anywhere 18 days many 254 days different individuals form
habit. reason bring up, always get asked, "Is true takes 21
days form habit?" "Is true nervous system changes six days" "when
something repeatedly?" answer is, mentioned before, highly
variable. didn't tell actually, specific habit looking
Lally study. interesting specific behavior health-related behavior.
pretty relevant discussion here, podcast. taking walks
dinner. actually really nice literature showing walks meal can
speed glucose clearance blood stream, can beneficial not just weight
loss, cardiovascular health, et cetera. walk dinner seems pretty straight-
forward, right? Well, order form habit, took people 18 days
people 254 days. know formed habit? Well,
85% time also reported not spend much mental
effort order get mode taking walk dinner. So,
listening, might thinking, "I can't believe take certain people
254 days" "to get habit." said, people highly variable can't
form one habit easily, doesn't mean can't form habits easily.
mystery certain people can form certain habits easily others? Probably
something people manage called limbic friction. Now, limbic
friction not term going find formal neurobiological literature
even psychological literature. It's, frankly, term coined encompass


number different pieces psychology neuroscience literature. Limbic
friction short-hand way use describe strain required order
overcome one two states within body. One state one anxiousness,
really anxious therefore can't calm down, can't relax, therefore
can't engage particular activity thought pattern like.
state one feeling tired lazy not motivated.
states, feeling alert calm, will, relate function so-called
autonomic nervous system, set neurons hormones chemicals brain
body act sort see-saw. either alert calm. either asleep
stressed. two states not compatible one another. probably
heard "wired tired" really stressed long
time, point exhausted. autonomic nervous system
this? Well, limbic friction phrase can used describe
much effort, much activation energy need order engage particular
behavior. So, using Lally study example, people eat dinner,
say, "Oh, right, trying develop habit" "of taking walk
dinner." "So, get go." people will feel like, "I just don't want
today." going feel much limbic friction limbic friction arrive,
again, one two sources. tired
anxious distracted order it. So, key
distinction. lot habit formation right state mind
able control state body mind. march forward,
going find phrase term, limbic friction, going useful metric
way touch address whether not likely
able form certain habit easily whether not going challenging.
going teach way measure degree limbic friction. is,
much activation energy will take order execute new habit. going
teach measure limbic friction

00:16:07 Linchpin Habits

activation energy likely going able break habit
don't want have. key concept us address really mainly
found books articles habits, notions call


linchpin habits. Linchpin habits certain habits make lot habits easier
execute. Now, sorts linchpin habits referring always going
things enjoy doing. just give example life. happen like
exercise. Not forms exercise, happen like resistance training happen
like running. personally habit getting cardiovascular exercise 3 4
times per week. Maybe 30-60 minutes per session. habit
resistance training 3 4 times per week, typically also 45 60 minutes per
session. Now, enjoy those, reasons get little bit later, enjoy
activities typically early day neurochemistry various types
hormones, et cetera, associates performing activities. really
place activities umbrella call linchpin habits. Why?
particular habits easy execute enjoy them. also make
lot habits easier execute. Things like alert work, things like making
sure get good sleep night before, things like hydration, things like making sure
eat foods better foods maybe
reflexively reach weren't training. certain habits act
linchpins, meaning shift lot things. can control bias
likelihood that, case me, will perform habits harder access,
less affinity for. again, three concepts need
include here. got identity-based versus goal-based habits. got concept
typically different habits take different periods time adopt, depending
person habit. these, call linchpin habits. Certain habits
make habits easier execute. linchpin habits always, always,
always things enjoy doing. goal throughout episode
identify habits easy perform, ones hard perform,
habits want break. want grab pen paper, can
that. want dictate phone, can. right now,
actually, just want think concepts, can always go back later,
sure spell specific way can chart map towards forming
particular habits breaking particular habits later on. like us point
take concepts limbic friction

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,
things basic brushing teeth breakfast, brushing teeth
breakfast. be, instance, get exercise get particular time
day, even take particular route work, right? habitual
tend things less way, unless intervene
ourselves. just way wired. now like shift thinking
particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious
over-ride state required order engage particular behavior. So,
feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious
lot work deal bunch things, lot limbic
friction overcome order get calm state. two aspects, context
dependence, whether not like thing regardless are.
Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

00:22:55 Automaticity

will tell whether not habit deeply just shallowly embedded within
nervous system. goal habit want form get called
automaticity. Automaticity fancy language neural circuits can perform
automatically, ultimate place be. right, goals
things want regular basis, love habitual
takes less mental physical effort, less limbic friction, order execute
those. much there, popular psychology literature,
books find bookstore shelf Amazon, airports,
get mode high degree limbic friction automaticity.
offer number different ways, think many useful, trying get
organize different types habits different bins, like value-based, goal-based,
trying persuade structuring habits particular times day
particular way going beneficial, indeed, think helped lot
people. like take scientific literature nervous system
learns engages plasticity, apply habit formation,



00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum

just way described trying initiate new habit. now like discuss
second, think perhaps powerful tool able acquire

framework this, adopt easily particular schedule. Phase one,
again, 0 8 hours waking, particular neurochemical signature.
Regardless do, neuromodulators norepinephrine well epinephrine,
noradrenaline adrenaline, well neuromodulator dopamine tend

several things perhaps doing, talked many
podcast before, addition chemicals, support alert

like access podcasts can find menu podcasts
YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. involve, instance, viewing sunlight bright
artificial light can't access sunlight, within first 30 minutes waking. Physical
exercise kind phase day, 0 8 hours day, ideally pretty
early phase, but, know, 7 8 hour transition point
fine too. Cold exposure form cold showers ice baths outside minimal

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-

that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit

going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form

actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going

says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular

exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps

be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then

even put shoes. fact successfully placing

quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,

foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward

powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge

episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.

Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways

00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits

neuroplasticity involves changes connections neurons, nerve
cells. Okay, describes habits lens neuroscience biology,
many well aware, popular books habits whole
psychological literature habits, two areas point interesting
aspects habits think worth mentioning. First notion immediate
goal-based habits versus identity-based habits. Immediate goal-based habits going
habits designed bring specific outcome them,
every time them. instance, might want develop habit
getting, know, 60 minutes zone II cardio day, perhaps 3-4 times per
week, head new year. talked podcast fact
scientific literature health literature really points incredibly positive
effects getting 150 minutes 180 minutes per week minimum called zone II
cardio. Zone II cardio basically cardiovascular exercise gets moving,
heart pumping, breathing, not hard can't hold conversation,
kind puts threshold just just able
conversation little bit strained, exercise little bit harder,
know, run little bit faster, et cetera, wouldn't able talk it.
lot literature points healthy practice. maybe somebody
wants get zone II cardio, instance. immediate goal-
based habit goal get cardio, maybe 4 times week. Every time
check off little box say, "Okay, it." met goal. different
so-called identity-based habits larger, over-arching theme
habit, trying become, quote unquote, "a fit person". somebody
wants athlete something sort. start attach
sort larger picture means habit
immediate goal, right? Complete exercise, complete session,
whatever is, check off box. linking sort larger goal.
Now, making distinction? mean, first all, not one first make
distinction. Others made distinction identity versus immediate
goal-based habit formation. reason making distinction pretty soon
discussion today going talk dopamine, molecule


associated motivation reward, make brain, different
schedules dopamine release predict will stick habit not.
particular, whether not will able form habit quickly

00:11:40 Long (Really) Takes Form Habit; Limbic-Friction

not. Now, absolutely critical understand following reason. Another
thing hear literature takes 21 days form habit.
people say 18, people say 21, people say 30 days, people say
60 days. one it? depend habit one trying form?
depend person trying form habit? Well, turns
excellent peer-reviewed data this. study published 2010, first author
Lally, L L L Y. study found that, habit formed, can take
anywhere 18 days many 254 days different individuals form
habit. reason bring up, always get asked, "Is true takes 21
days form habit?" "Is true nervous system changes six days" "when
something repeatedly?" answer is, mentioned before, highly
variable. didn't tell actually, specific habit looking
Lally study. interesting specific behavior health-related behavior.
pretty relevant discussion here, podcast. taking walks
dinner. actually really nice literature showing walks meal can
speed glucose clearance blood stream, can beneficial not just weight
loss, cardiovascular health, et cetera. walk dinner seems pretty straight-
forward, right? Well, order form habit, took people 18 days
people 254 days. know formed habit? Well,
85% time also reported not spend much mental
effort order get mode taking walk dinner. So,
listening, might thinking, "I can't believe take certain people
254 days" "to get habit." said, people highly variable can't
form one habit easily, doesn't mean can't form habits easily.
mystery certain people can form certain habits easily others? Probably
something people manage called limbic friction. Now, limbic
friction not term going find formal neurobiological literature
even psychological literature. It's, frankly, term coined encompass


number different pieces psychology neuroscience literature. Limbic
friction short-hand way use describe strain required order
overcome one two states within body. One state one anxiousness,
really anxious therefore can't calm down, can't relax, therefore
can't engage particular activity thought pattern like.
state one feeling tired lazy not motivated.
states, feeling alert calm, will, relate function so-called
autonomic nervous system, set neurons hormones chemicals brain
body act sort see-saw. either alert calm. either asleep
stressed. two states not compatible one another. probably
heard "wired tired" really stressed long
time, point exhausted. autonomic nervous system
this? Well, limbic friction phrase can used describe
much effort, much activation energy need order engage particular
behavior. So, using Lally study example, people eat dinner,
say, "Oh, right, trying develop habit" "of taking walk
dinner." "So, get go." people will feel like, "I just don't want
today." going feel much limbic friction limbic friction arrive,
again, one two sources. tired
anxious distracted order it. So, key
distinction. lot habit formation right state mind
able control state body mind. march forward,
going find phrase term, limbic friction, going useful metric
way touch address whether not likely
able form certain habit easily whether not going challenging.
going teach way measure degree limbic friction. is,
much activation energy will take order execute new habit. going
teach measure limbic friction

00:16:07 Linchpin Habits

activation energy likely going able break habit
don't want have. key concept us address really mainly
found books articles habits, notions call


linchpin habits. Linchpin habits certain habits make lot habits easier
execute. Now, sorts linchpin habits referring always going
things enjoy doing. just give example life. happen like
exercise. Not forms exercise, happen like resistance training happen
like running. personally habit getting cardiovascular exercise 3 4
times per week. Maybe 30-60 minutes per session. habit
resistance training 3 4 times per week, typically also 45 60 minutes per
session. Now, enjoy those, reasons get little bit later, enjoy
activities typically early day neurochemistry various types
hormones, et cetera, associates performing activities. really
place activities umbrella call linchpin habits. Why?
particular habits easy execute enjoy them. also make
lot habits easier execute. Things like alert work, things like making
sure get good sleep night before, things like hydration, things like making sure
eat foods better foods maybe
reflexively reach weren't training. certain habits act
linchpins, meaning shift lot things. can control bias
likelihood that, case me, will perform habits harder access,
less affinity for. again, three concepts need
include here. got identity-based versus goal-based habits. got concept
typically different habits take different periods time adopt, depending
person habit. these, call linchpin habits. Certain habits
make habits easier execute. linchpin habits always, always,
always things enjoy doing. goal throughout episode
identify habits easy perform, ones hard perform,
habits want break. want grab pen paper, can
that. want dictate phone, can. right now,
actually, just want think concepts, can always go back later,
sure spell specific way can chart map towards forming
particular habits breaking particular habits later on. like us point
take concepts limbic friction

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,
things basic brushing teeth breakfast, brushing teeth
breakfast. be, instance, get exercise get particular time
day, even take particular route work, right? habitual
tend things less way, unless intervene
ourselves. just way wired. now like shift thinking
particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious
over-ride state required order engage particular behavior. So,
feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious
lot work deal bunch things, lot limbic
friction overcome order get calm state. two aspects, context
dependence, whether not like thing regardless are.
Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

00:22:55 Automaticity

will tell whether not habit deeply just shallowly embedded within
nervous system. goal habit want form get called
automaticity. Automaticity fancy language neural circuits can perform
automatically, ultimate place be. right, goals
things want regular basis, love habitual
takes less mental physical effort, less limbic friction, order execute
those. much there, popular psychology literature,
books find bookstore shelf Amazon, airports,
get mode high degree limbic friction automaticity.
offer number different ways, think many useful, trying get
organize different types habits different bins, like value-based, goal-based,
trying persuade structuring habits particular times day
particular way going beneficial, indeed, think helped lot
people. like take scientific literature nervous system
learns engages plasticity, apply habit formation,



00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum

just way described trying initiate new habit. now like discuss
second, think perhaps powerful tool able acquire

saying, "Just tell do." say, always say,
understanding little bit lot underlying mechanism will help solidify

several things perhaps doing, talked many
podcast before, addition chemicals, support alert

like access podcasts can find menu podcasts
YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. involve, instance, viewing sunlight bright
artificial light can't access sunlight, within first 30 minutes waking. Physical
exercise kind phase day, 0 8 hours day, ideally pretty
early phase, but, know, 7 8 hour transition point
fine too. Cold exposure form cold showers ice baths outside minimal

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise

tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-

that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop

going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive

going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not

says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular

exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps

be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then

even put shoes. fact successfully placing

quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,

foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold

powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence

habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine

episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.

Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch

kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted

particular, whether not will able form habit quickly

00:11:40 Long (Really) Takes Form Habit; Limbic-Friction

not. Now, absolutely critical understand following reason. Another
thing hear literature takes 21 days form habit.
people say 18, people say 21, people say 30 days, people say
60 days. one it? depend habit one trying form?
depend person trying form habit? Well, turns
excellent peer-reviewed data this. study published 2010, first author
Lally, L L L Y. study found that, habit formed, can take
anywhere 18 days many 254 days different individuals form
habit. reason bring up, always get asked, "Is true takes 21
days form habit?" "Is true nervous system changes six days" "when
something repeatedly?" answer is, mentioned before, highly
variable. didn't tell actually, specific habit looking
Lally study. interesting specific behavior health-related behavior.
pretty relevant discussion here, podcast. taking walks
dinner. actually really nice literature showing walks meal can
speed glucose clearance blood stream, can beneficial not just weight
loss, cardiovascular health, et cetera. walk dinner seems pretty straight-
forward, right? Well, order form habit, took people 18 days
people 254 days. know formed habit? Well,
85% time also reported not spend much mental
effort order get mode taking walk dinner. So,
listening, might thinking, "I can't believe take certain people
254 days" "to get habit." said, people highly variable can't
form one habit easily, doesn't mean can't form habits easily.
mystery certain people can form certain habits easily others? Probably
something people manage called limbic friction. Now, limbic
friction not term going find formal neurobiological literature
even psychological literature. It's, frankly, term coined encompass


number different pieces psychology neuroscience literature. Limbic
friction short-hand way use describe strain required order
overcome one two states within body. One state one anxiousness,
really anxious therefore can't calm down, can't relax, therefore
can't engage particular activity thought pattern like.
state one feeling tired lazy not motivated.
states, feeling alert calm, will, relate function so-called
autonomic nervous system, set neurons hormones chemicals brain
body act sort see-saw. either alert calm. either asleep
stressed. two states not compatible one another. probably
heard "wired tired" really stressed long
time, point exhausted. autonomic nervous system
this? Well, limbic friction phrase can used describe
much effort, much activation energy need order engage particular
behavior. So, using Lally study example, people eat dinner,
say, "Oh, right, trying develop habit" "of taking walk
dinner." "So, get go." people will feel like, "I just don't want
today." going feel much limbic friction limbic friction arrive,
again, one two sources. tired
anxious distracted order it. So, key
distinction. lot habit formation right state mind
able control state body mind. march forward,
going find phrase term, limbic friction, going useful metric
way touch address whether not likely
able form certain habit easily whether not going challenging.
going teach way measure degree limbic friction. is,
much activation energy will take order execute new habit. going
teach measure limbic friction

00:16:07 Linchpin Habits

activation energy likely going able break habit
don't want have. key concept us address really mainly
found books articles habits, notions call


linchpin habits. Linchpin habits certain habits make lot habits easier
execute. Now, sorts linchpin habits referring always going
things enjoy doing. just give example life. happen like
exercise. Not forms exercise, happen like resistance training happen
like running. personally habit getting cardiovascular exercise 3 4
times per week. Maybe 30-60 minutes per session. habit
resistance training 3 4 times per week, typically also 45 60 minutes per
session. Now, enjoy those, reasons get little bit later, enjoy
activities typically early day neurochemistry various types
hormones, et cetera, associates performing activities. really
place activities umbrella call linchpin habits. Why?
particular habits easy execute enjoy them. also make
lot habits easier execute. Things like alert work, things like making
sure get good sleep night before, things like hydration, things like making sure
eat foods better foods maybe
reflexively reach weren't training. certain habits act
linchpins, meaning shift lot things. can control bias
likelihood that, case me, will perform habits harder access,
less affinity for. again, three concepts need
include here. got identity-based versus goal-based habits. got concept
typically different habits take different periods time adopt, depending
person habit. these, call linchpin habits. Certain habits
make habits easier execute. linchpin habits always, always,
always things enjoy doing. goal throughout episode
identify habits easy perform, ones hard perform,
habits want break. want grab pen paper, can
that. want dictate phone, can. right now,
actually, just want think concepts, can always go back later,
sure spell specific way can chart map towards forming
particular habits breaking particular habits later on. like us point
take concepts limbic friction

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,
things basic brushing teeth breakfast, brushing teeth
breakfast. be, instance, get exercise get particular time
day, even take particular route work, right? habitual
tend things less way, unless intervene
ourselves. just way wired. now like shift thinking
particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious
over-ride state required order engage particular behavior. So,
feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious
lot work deal bunch things, lot limbic
friction overcome order get calm state. two aspects, context
dependence, whether not like thing regardless are.
Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

00:22:55 Automaticity

will tell whether not habit deeply just shallowly embedded within
nervous system. goal habit want form get called
automaticity. Automaticity fancy language neural circuits can perform
automatically, ultimate place be. right, goals
things want regular basis, love habitual
takes less mental physical effort, less limbic friction, order execute
those. much there, popular psychology literature,
books find bookstore shelf Amazon, airports,
get mode high degree limbic friction automaticity.
offer number different ways, think many useful, trying get
organize different types habits different bins, like value-based, goal-based,
trying persuade structuring habits particular times day
particular way going beneficial, indeed, think helped lot
people. like take scientific literature nervous system
learns engages plasticity, apply habit formation,



00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum

just way described trying initiate new habit. now like discuss
second, think perhaps powerful tool able acquire

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing

receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward

tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps

be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then

broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel

quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,

foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge

episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging

thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already

neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout

can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact

say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I

warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.

little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever

problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can

Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord

play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type

fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional

fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted

rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad

number different pieces psychology neuroscience literature. Limbic
friction short-hand way use describe strain required order
overcome one two states within body. One state one anxiousness,
really anxious therefore can't calm down, can't relax, therefore
can't engage particular activity thought pattern like.
state one feeling tired lazy not motivated.
states, feeling alert calm, will, relate function so-called
autonomic nervous system, set neurons hormones chemicals brain
body act sort see-saw. either alert calm. either asleep
stressed. two states not compatible one another. probably
heard "wired tired" really stressed long
time, point exhausted. autonomic nervous system
this? Well, limbic friction phrase can used describe
much effort, much activation energy need order engage particular
behavior. So, using Lally study example, people eat dinner,
say, "Oh, right, trying develop habit" "of taking walk
dinner." "So, get go." people will feel like, "I just don't want
today." going feel much limbic friction limbic friction arrive,
again, one two sources. tired
anxious distracted order it. So, key
distinction. lot habit formation right state mind
able control state body mind. march forward,
going find phrase term, limbic friction, going useful metric
way touch address whether not likely
able form certain habit easily whether not going challenging.
going teach way measure degree limbic friction. is,
much activation energy will take order execute new habit. going
teach measure limbic friction

00:16:07 Linchpin Habits

activation energy likely going able break habit
don't want have. key concept us address really mainly
found books articles habits, notions call


linchpin habits. Linchpin habits certain habits make lot habits easier
execute. Now, sorts linchpin habits referring always going
things enjoy doing. just give example life. happen like
exercise. Not forms exercise, happen like resistance training happen
like running. personally habit getting cardiovascular exercise 3 4
times per week. Maybe 30-60 minutes per session. habit
resistance training 3 4 times per week, typically also 45 60 minutes per
session. Now, enjoy those, reasons get little bit later, enjoy
activities typically early day neurochemistry various types
hormones, et cetera, associates performing activities. really
place activities umbrella call linchpin habits. Why?
particular habits easy execute enjoy them. also make
lot habits easier execute. Things like alert work, things like making
sure get good sleep night before, things like hydration, things like making sure
eat foods better foods maybe
reflexively reach weren't training. certain habits act
linchpins, meaning shift lot things. can control bias
likelihood that, case me, will perform habits harder access,
less affinity for. again, three concepts need
include here. got identity-based versus goal-based habits. got concept
typically different habits take different periods time adopt, depending
person habit. these, call linchpin habits. Certain habits
make habits easier execute. linchpin habits always, always,
always things enjoy doing. goal throughout episode
identify habits easy perform, ones hard perform,
habits want break. want grab pen paper, can
that. want dictate phone, can. right now,
actually, just want think concepts, can always go back later,
sure spell specific way can chart map towards forming
particular habits breaking particular habits later on. like us point
take concepts limbic friction

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,
things basic brushing teeth breakfast, brushing teeth
breakfast. be, instance, get exercise get particular time
day, even take particular route work, right? habitual
tend things less way, unless intervene
ourselves. just way wired. now like shift thinking
particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious
over-ride state required order engage particular behavior. So,
feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious
lot work deal bunch things, lot limbic
friction overcome order get calm state. two aspects, context
dependence, whether not like thing regardless are.
Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

00:22:55 Automaticity

will tell whether not habit deeply just shallowly embedded within
nervous system. goal habit want form get called
automaticity. Automaticity fancy language neural circuits can perform
automatically, ultimate place be. right, goals
things want regular basis, love habitual
takes less mental physical effort, less limbic friction, order execute
those. much there, popular psychology literature,
books find bookstore shelf Amazon, airports,
get mode high degree limbic friction automaticity.
offer number different ways, think many useful, trying get
organize different types habits different bins, like value-based, goal-based,
trying persuade structuring habits particular times day
particular way going beneficial, indeed, think helped lot
people. like take scientific literature nervous system
learns engages plasticity, apply habit formation,



00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum

just way described trying initiate new habit. now like discuss
second, think perhaps powerful tool able acquire
stick new habits. tool rooted call neural circuits think
important understand little bit neural circuits work.
saying, "Just tell do." say, always say,
understanding little bit lot underlying mechanism will help solidify
concepts will help ensure tools offer going make sense


going make sense differing contexts different types habits
tying learn. So, rather just tell do, going tell
particular tool works, that, able apply
habit, conditions. tool referring something called task-
bracketing neural circuits associated task-bracketing basically
neural circuits going allow learn new type habit break
habit like break. brain set neural circuits fall
umbrella term basal ganglia. basal ganglia involved action

things. experimental realm, referred go, meaning do, no go,
don't do, certain things. us fall category find easy
certain things, harder not things. people lot no go
type circuits robust, lot behavioral constraint,
harder time getting action. people perfect balance both,
never met one people. again, drawing from, less
paraphrasing beautiful review described earlier Annual Review
Psychology, excuse me, Wood Ruenger, task-bracketing involves particular set
neural circuits within basal ganglia, going describe here,
paraphrasing, sensory-motor loop. Sensory means just input coming sight,
sounds, taste, et cetera. motor systems, systems brain body
generate action, taking information generating action. turns
area basal ganglia called dorsolateral striatum, can use
acronym DLS. Again, dorsolateral striatum. Dorso means up. Lateral means side.
dorsolateral. striatum subdivision basal ganglia.
important establishment behaviors associated habit, not
necessarily habit itself. beautiful studies animals humans record
activity dorsolateral striatum find dorsolateral striatum associated,
meaning becomes active beginning particular habit, end
particular habit. Hence phrase task-bracketing. brackets habit. Now,
sets neurons going active actual execution habit,
literature dorsolateral striatum tells us particular circuits
brain devoted framing events happened just
initiate habit, just terminate habit. words, acts sort
marker habit execution, not execution habit per se.


important task-bracketing underlies whether not habit will
context dependent not, whether not will strong likely occur even
didn't get good night's sleep night before, even feeling distracted, even
not feeling like something emotionally, are, know, completely
overwhelmed events. neural circuits task bracketing, deeply
embedded us, meaning robust around particular habit, well
likely going go zone II cardio no matter what, going
brush teeth no matter what. fact, brushing teeth pretty good example
because, people, even got terrible night's sleep, even everything
life going wrong, chances are, unless depressed, going
leave work, even not, going still carry behavior
brushing teeth morning. hope so, actually. probably less
likely perform particular habits not deem necessary.
think it, brushing teeth, exercise, eating particular foods, maybe engaging

probably asking, okay, perform particular habit phase one,
habits phase two, eventually get point


engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet
paper particular musical piece transferred off different brain area. So,
whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration
information brain. migrated different location brain,
point achieved context-independence. doesn't bracketed by,
know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,

perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,

adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,

programs one another, hopefully will easy, based descriptions
given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

00:18:55 Mapping Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence



ask habits perform daily basis,

particular aspect habits habit strength. Now, different
habits. probably brush teeth particular time day, probably exercise
particular times week, probably go refrigerator habitual way.
incredibly habitual organisms. Unless intervene habits, tend carry
way always formed. can
exercise now, don't write don't want to, certainly
welcome. going evaluate called habit strength. not concept
created. Habit strength something will find psychological literature.
Habit strength measured two main criteria. first, context-dependent
give habit is. So, context dependence is, go one environment next,
tend thing, way, time day? So,
instance, brushing teeth firs thing morning. Maybe
breakfast, maybe later, maybe you, like me, don't even eat
breakfast. travel, tend brush teeth less time
day relative wake home. context independent.
strong habit, right? certain behaviors, like perhaps eat, or,
know, perhaps dress, context independent, might perform
one way one context, another way another context. aspect habit
strength much limbic friction required perform habit regular basis.
extremely important process building habits
consolidating habits, probably going take limbic friction execute
habits. mean that? Well, say set get, say 45
minutes zone II cardio exercise every day, 5 maybe even 7 days week. Well,
first highly motivated, limbic friction might pretty low. Limbic friction
much top-down, meaning fore-brain limbic system, part
brain generates autonomic responses, much limbic friction, meaning conscious

feeling particularly tired don't want get bed, don't want


go zone II cardio, high degree limbic friction. takes,
people think motivation, motivation bit vague concept, whereas
limbic friction involves specific neural circuits can think less
quantitative way. can think body tired, going take
limbic friction order get action. Right? going overcome
limbic friction, excuse me. Whereas very, alert, less limbic friction
moving toward something action oriented. However, inverse
also true. say trying get habit, early stages
forming habit meditate regularly. pretty quiescent calming activity,
somebody comes home work anxious

Right? travel, home, vacation, people around, not people around, et
cetera. much limbic friction required execute habit,

procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall

simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get

morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just

reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not

However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will

again. think something's coming going great, say lean

contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark

going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form

actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going

says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing

quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time

people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final

big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,

powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence

habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

not line bad behavior, give example. say find

engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't

engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think

Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick

capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

not line bad behavior, give example. say find

engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't

earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going

broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,

habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing

functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations

habit maintenance, desired, break particular habits. like give
particular tool gleaned research psychology literature. mention
learned excellent review article available online. called
Psychology Habit. authors Wendy Wood Dennis Ruenger,
published Annual Review Psychology. Annual Reviews series high
quality series. annual reviews neuroscience, annual reviews psychology,
annual reviews nutrition science, et cetera. interested
exploring review articles grounded hundreds quality, peer-reviewed studies,
Annual Review series really terrific. Certainly among best, not best.
also tend quite long quite comprehensive. review, Psychology
Habit Wood Ruenger, excellent. less paraphrasing
them, want clear words, not mine. talking
various ways habits form nervous system mention,
repetition habit, small changes occur cognitive neural mechanisms
associated procedural memory. just want talk second
procedural memory is. neuroscience memory, distinguish
called episodic memory procedural memory. Episodic memory recall
particular set events happened, whereas procedural memory holding mind
specific sequence things need happen order particular outcome
occur. think like recipe protocol, sake exercise, like sets
reps, particular course going run cycle, number laps
going swim going perform it. clear anyone
trying adopt new habits, getting mindset procedural memory useful
overcoming barrier call limbic friction. that? Well,
simple visualization exercise, doesn't even done eyes closed. know,
often times hear visualization exercise, think sitting lotus position,
eyes closed, know, trying really hard visualize something. Doesn't need
anything like that. can simply be, deciding adopt new habit, just think
specific sequence steps required execute habit.
use trivial example, applied anything. say want get
habit making myself, someone else household, cup espresso every
morning, actually think steps. Walk kitchen, turn


espresso machine, draw espresso. Walking steps,
start finish, turns just simple mental exercise done can shift
people towards much higher likelihood performing habit regularly, not just
first time, continue days weeks follow.
remarkable literature really robust. Just one mental exercise thinking
sequence steps required order perform habit start
finish can shift likelihood able perform habit unlikely
moderately likely, likely time. pulls process
involves hippocampus neocortex areas brain
nervous system, engage procedural memory. shifts brain towards
mindset, will. neural circuit set, accurate.
mindset/neural circuit set things particular sequence, allows
limbic friction come increases likelihood going perform
thing.

00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors

Simple tool powerful too, according psychology literature. actually,
cellular molecular mechanisms underlie sort procedural memory,
stepping phenomenon known. article mentioned, beautiful
review, talk called Hebbian learning. Donald Hebb psychologist
Canada birthed field now lasted, gosh, 50 years still
strong neuroscience psychology Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning
particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend
strengthen connections one another. number different cellular
molecular features don't go detail,
want know, know hungry little bit neuroscience,
involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit
them. receptors neuron's surface normally don't
contribute much activity neurons. neurons perfectly capable
thing without activation NMDA receptor. neuron gets
strong input, strong stimulus, NMDA receptor triggers number
mechanisms recruit surface neuron receptors.


words, makes neuron responsive input future doesn't
require much input. words, takes neuron unlikely fire
makes likely fire. procedural stepping steps recipe
series actions steps involved sitting study writing
hour, generating exercise, whatever habit trying learn.
exercise, not nervous system thinks actually
performing behavior. nervous system isn't stupid. actually lot smarter
that. knows difference thought action,
that, sets motion neurons going required execution
habit. actually show perform habit,
dominoes fall easily. lower threshold, say, order get habit
perform. So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, nuts bolts stuff. Really
guts mechanisms works. just want
habitual certain things, able perform certain things reflexively,
like life, simply take time, once, maybe twice, just sit down,
close eyes like, just step procedure going take
order perform habit. psychology literature, mentioned, also
neuroscience literature, strongly supports fact going make far easier
adopt maintain habit. somebody used perform
habit, don't understand dropped it, frustrated yourself,
trying figure can get back habit, well means,
lean right back habit, trouble that, also just use
procedural memory exercise order shift nervous system towards higher
likelihood will return habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise

tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark

that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop

tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going

"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological

formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior

everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

particular neurons co-active, meaning fire together, tend

involves things like NMDA receptors methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NMDA receptors
really important think everyone understand. just tell little bit

Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,

actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think

Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,

expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built

"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,

everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-

that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit

going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form

actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going

says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset

words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit

back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going

broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not

numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge

episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging

thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.

play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons

way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off

consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation

Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know

hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked

hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.

particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior

perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes

habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,

picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing

habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,

one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors

01:01:34 Habit Flexibility

won't feel much limbic friction override much limbic friction.
probably asking, okay, perform particular habit phase one,
habits phase two, eventually get point


engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet
paper particular musical piece transferred off different brain area. So,
whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration
information brain. migrated different location brain,

know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,

test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior

able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional

something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,

perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,

adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,

given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

01:01:34 Habit Flexibility

won't feel much limbic friction override much limbic friction.
probably asking, okay, perform particular habit phase one,
habits phase two, eventually get point


engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet
paper particular musical piece transferred off different brain area. So,
whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration
information brain. migrated different location brain,

know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral

habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps

habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies

thing took review finding notifications either engage

effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric

electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior

cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

01:01:34 Habit Flexibility

won't feel much limbic friction override much limbic friction.
probably asking, okay, perform particular habit phase one,
habits phase two, eventually get point


engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet
paper particular musical piece transferred off different brain area. So,
whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration
information brain. migrated different location brain,
point achieved context-independence. doesn't bracketed by,
know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really

kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically

can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21

habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,

kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time

expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated

However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not

formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,

perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,

try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage

different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed

engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.

hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,

perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,

nothing holy system. particular system number features,

adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,

programs one another, hopefully will easy, based descriptions
given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage

different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find

picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit

going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form

actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going

says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get

Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward

changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going

broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward

episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing

rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21

Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage

effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

not line bad behavior, give example. say find

engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

program involves dividing 24 hour day three phases, phase one, phase two,
phase three, try tackle specific habits particular phases 24 hour
cycle. second program involved 21 day process engaging approximately 6 new
habits per day, although expectation, mentioned earlier, not going
perform 6 those. assessment following 21 days whether
not indeed formed new habits not. number

engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk

capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch

real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know

hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,

neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,

whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration

going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-

earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological

formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect

functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch

it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off

outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior

engaging habits pretty effortless way, keep phase
day? good news is, literature says doesn't matter. fact, moving
particular habit around somewhat randomly can actually beneficial
actually moving one time day context independence
really seeking. able thing want
regardless time day circumstances know achieved
real habit formation, know habit moved certain
components neural circuity just allow us seems like reflexively.
Although earlier pointed aren't reflexes traditional sense.
reason brain area, hippocampus, many know
associated learning memory, not actually memories stored.
hippocampus memories formed, procedures, like talked
before, procedural memory going execute particular sequence,
maintained. like use recipe model, recipe
maintained know cook dish procedural memory
literally migrates off different set neural circuits, neural circuits
neocortex maps sensory experience, maps kinds
experiences, including motor maps execute things. use one part
brain learn something, information, form electrical activity
neurons, passed off different brain area. Now, neurons don't move
hippocampus cortex, doesn't happen. happens signals,
sequence electrical firing, much like script movie notes sheet
paper particular musical piece transferred off different brain area. So,
whole process really leaning something hard, becoming easier,
eventually things becoming less reflexive involves migration
information brain. migrated different location brain,
point achieved context-independence. doesn't bracketed by,
know, caffeine lunch. doesn't occur immediately
afternoon NSDR, four O'clock meeting Zoom, something
sort. say something become reflexive, play
little bit time day. want keep phase day, great.
one day decide going exercise afternoon, next day decide
going exercise morning, habit concerned with,
terrific. able that, means truly achieved context-


independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological

formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors

independence. means officially formed habit. mentioned
earlier, much earlier beginning episode, strength habit dictated
much limbic friction, one, much context dependence is.
doesn't take much activation energy get execution habit

01:04:57 Reward Ourselves? How? When? NOT to.

can context, well, formed habit. really can't
discussion learning anything, habits otherwise, unless talk
reward prediction error. Reward prediction error associated molecule
dopamine, although say neurochemicals brain body
also related reward prediction error. reward prediction error good
system, say, lens think about, whether not
reward performing given habit. much larger discussion
actually relates things like parenting self-regulation. know, reward
kids just effort? reward just effort? reward?
much reward ourselves? withdraw reward?
use punishment? kinds things. vast literature. don't time
go details, notion reward prediction error powerful can
predict not forms learning, including habit formation. can deploy
use particular features reward prediction error like reinforce
accelerate formation certain habits. So, reward prediction error, quite simply,
expect reward reward comes, particular behavior associated
generating reward likely occur again. pretty straight forward.
However, amount reward, form molecule dopamine, will
experience even greater reward arrives unexpected. Okay. let repeat
again. think something's coming going great, say lean
habit, manage override limbic friction, 45 minutes writing
morning no phone no internet getting toward end,
anticipating actually this, great, it, feeling really, really
good. finish, definitely will receive dopamine reward, make dopamine
reward, comes from. Remember, internal. However, will also
receive dopamine reward unexpectedly something positive happens. typically
something unexpected positive happens, amount dopamine reward


get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,
wanted. idea isn't something year long.
perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,
set make 21 day really stimulus period habits get wired
following month, maybe even following months, periods 21 days,
really kind thermometer test bed well embedded

certain habits weren't able embed nervous system make

nothing holy system. particular system number features,

adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,
phase two, phase three type system talked earlier, collapse two
programs one another, hopefully will easy, based descriptions
given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

get actually much greater conditions. However, hard surprise
behavior deliberately engaging in. becomes bit
tricky one. Reward prediction error also says expect reward reward
doesn't come pattern dopamine release will follow particular contour
contour important. goes. say writing
30 45 minutes in, thinking, "Ah, great." "I'm actually, managed this"
"I'm succeeding executing behaviors" "that need order perform habit."
"I'm overriding limbic friction." Just series thoughts will start generate
dopamine release within brain body. However, 15 minute mark
phone rings pick phone break protocol, break self-
discipline go check social media something takes
that, going happen level dopamine actually going drop
baseline, meaning level dopamine even started habit
execution. Okay? is, system predicts whether not rewards
going come. think reward going come, starts actually arrive
earlier form dopamine release. feeling experience positive
anticipation. tell kid, "Hey, going go amusement park." "We're
going go get ice cream." haven't ice cream yet, not
amusement park, excited, dopamine release comes earlier. Okay?
get amusement park get ice cream, will also dopamine
release associated that. it, believe not, came form
anticipation. dopamine qualities make actual ice cream
actual amusement park experience pleasurable
dopamine release not happened. Now course, way surprise kid.
tell them, "Listen, going class absolutely hate." "We're going
go see person" "that absolutely despise." drive
amusement park big release dopamine. reward prediction error also
says tell kid, yourself, "Okay, headed amusement park."
"We're going get ice cream." really, really excited. get
closed, not letting people in, well dopamine
level drops way told headed there.
Okay? given number different examples hopefully make clear. Reward
prediction error governs virtually aspects effort aspects learning. Why?
dopamine released brain body, neural circuits


brain body change. state change. level, excuse me, overall
level energy, also sorts sensory events paying attention
changes lot dopamine system.

01:10:30 Tool 4: “Dopamine Spotlighting” & Task Bracketing

Now can leverage habit formation. Think back task bracketing. Think back
limbic friction. considering adopting new habit trying break
habit, something haven't talked much about, will moment,
useful think not just procedural aspects going do, also
think events precede follow particular habit, execution,
least effort execute habit. casting kind
spotlight around bin time, set events, dopamine can associated.
look like practical sense? Well again, just try use
simple concrete examples, carry anything. say
somebody hard time getting 30 60 minutes zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning. actually issue me. much prefer resistance
exercise cardiovascular exercise, although it, always feel much better
done it. positively anticipate onset offset
session. Right? thinking leaning effort, going zone II
cardio session, think going feel after. So, not just thinking
great going feel after, also thinking hard going
beginning, trying reward subjectively entire experience.
words, start rewarding task-bracketing addition rewarding execution
habit itself. Now might saying, "Well, wait self-talk." "This
just positive self-talk." not positive self-talk, not saying, know, "I feel
great something" "that actually hate." can't lie yourself,
welcome lie yourself, neuroscience literature, literature growth
mindset, literature basically mindset speaks fact lie
yourself, know lying, actually set opposite reward system.
So, brutally honest that, instance, "I don't like initiating
cardiovascular exercise" "but like fact done it" "after done it."
applying reward prediction error entire sequence
things involved getting habit execution, getting habit


execution, getting habit execution. this? Well, take us
back procedural memory visualization exercises talked earlier.
talked context, talked walking mentally series steps
required perform particular habit. case zone II cardio thing
be, "Okay put shoes," "then going head door," "then
going drive road." particular canyon near that, going
run, happen like running, don't hate running enough tend it. Going
that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. great, even better
broaden time bin start positively anticipate period headed habit,
even put shoes. fact successfully placing
habit in, case, phase one day afterwards going feel
particular set positive benefits, elevated mood, et cetera. like hungry
quickly exercise hungry, like hungry like eating,
whole set things link one another. not just thinking habit
execution isolated little set events, little time bin, rather, drawing
larger envelope around starting positively associate dopamine reward
larger envelope. thinking, "Well, just
psychological trick." know, kind like, "This sort like lying yourself."
not not actually contradicting fact unpleasant.
taking entire series events, calling kind
time envelope, associating particular reward comes later,
feeling that, know, completed this. Right?
usually good feeling. reward prediction error beautiful, not just
sort math anticipation reward, math anticipation
disappointment, beautiful can stretch make narrow time
bins reward prediction error works. Reward prediction error way
people navigate four year degrees. Right? mean, go, sure, final exam final
exam, et cetera. ultimately, big payoff end basically
big payoff. course, understand journey, not destination,
face it, lot us goals habits achieving sort destination.
case zone II cardio, trying stay alive long can,
long can vitality, is. also fact that, get eat
foods like. tend able eat more, happen really enjoy eating,
much like just activity. basically trying not


restrict thinking just habit trying form, rather, grab ahold
timing particular habit start positively associate reward
mechanisms brain entire time bin. useful
powerful tool order form habits. say not something comes
naturally people. fact, even describe it, might find still little bit
abstract, encourage do, finding little bit vague,
pick habit want form, write think
concretely sequence steps involved execution habit,
write think sequence events need precede habit,
maybe immediate 10 15 minutes before, well immediate sequence
events and/or feelings will occur habit, call whole thing
habit execution. whole thing effort engage particular habit.
that, positively associating idea going complete entire
sequence, will engage reward prediction error proper way dopamine
surge can lend towards motivation. ultimately, dopamine not
feeling good, feeling motivated. something talked
numerous times before, dopamine, contrary popular belief, not reward
molecule, much molecule motivation drive. natural
consequence exercise just described, writing things precede,
involved immediate execution habit, follow habit, will allow
experience increase energy thereby increase likelihood
going engage entire sequence events. reason
dopamine gives us energy, reason molecule epinephrine,
adrenaline, actually manufactured dopamine. Biochemically, comes
dopamine. So, dopamine powerful can access dopamine around even
habits haven't yet formed taking broader time envelope task-
bracketing specific task execution habit execution. Way back beginning
episode, promised deliver two programs geared towards
habit formation. promised give ways gauge
whether not certain habits moved high effort, call high limbic friction,
reflexive. talked number way gauge that. researching
episode, found tremendous number different systems habit formation. really
amazing much there. There, one says 60 days this, 21 days that,
18 days this. mean,



01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,
wanted. idea isn't something year long.
perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,
set make 21 day really stimulus period habits get wired
following month, maybe even following months, periods 21 days,
really kind thermometer test bed well embedded
particular habits. indeed want continue add new habits find
certain habits weren't able embed nervous system make
reflexive, want bring in, fantastic. achieved
6 habits reflexive, move forward. think sort system,
replaced many different systems. Again,
nothing holy system. particular system number features,
lack compensation missed days, fact fairly high intensity program
21 days, test yourself, kind competition test yourself, will.
features fact habit slips, missing particular habits not
6 kind built system, think makes reasonable one.
adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,
phase two, phase three type system talked earlier, collapse two
programs one another, hopefully will easy, based descriptions
given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first
author review Fritz, F R T Z. certainly put link this. Heather Fritz
"Intervention modify habits: scoping review." indeed broad
scale review. Journal Occupation Participation Health. published
2020. really nice article. couple things learned article

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk

capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,

subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass

particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA

together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long

pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal

interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons

problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can

Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors

engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think

21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,

expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things

performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6

particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,

psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian

01:18:22 Tool 5: 21-Day Habit Installation & Testing System

just rampant popular psychology literature self-help literature. want
spell particular system think useful not people
rooted biology habit formation, rooted psychology habit
formation, entirely compatible phase one, phase two, phase three
type program talked earlier, encompasses bit longer time scale
really arrives kind system, will, build habits
test whether not habits really stuck whether not likely
stick going forward. this, least sake example, 21 day system.
picked 21 days seems average typical system
engaging neuroplasticity relates formation new habits. 21 day system,
actually, one someone know well uses used long time.
actually, kids use well. certain elegance think
describe elegance will begin reveal itself. basically involves
set perform 6 new habits per day across course 21 days. 6
21? Well, talk moment. idea is, write 6 things
like every day 21 days. phase day things fall into?
Well, will depend relate earlier phase one,
phase two, phase three, now, 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
expectation complete 4 5 day. Okay? built
kind permission fail, not failure, turns approach
forming habits based not much specific habits trying form,
habit performing habits. Right? habit certain number things
per day. So, set perform 6. Now, another reason not necessarily
performing 6 activities probably shouldn't performed day.
instance, case, weight train even run every day, sort,
biology sort don't recover well. wouldn't want resistance
training every day, might want 4 days week, instance. 6
things list, shuffle particular activity particular days
week, simply 4 5 activities. 21 days, list 4 5 things.
might zone II cardio, resistance training, sunlight viewing, writing journaling,
learning language, mathematics. going vary depending


particular goal habits trying create. no six
expectation not going perform 4 5. miss day,
meaning don't perform 4 5 things, no punishment. fact
important don't actually try what, literature, called habit slip
compensation, just fancy psychological language screw
don't get 4 5 one day, don't 8 next day order compensate.
actually brings back example graduate school. remember
started graduate school feeling excited, little bit overwhelmed amount
things research, coursework,
time graduate students stipends, still now unfortunately, depressingly low
financially stressful. number things happening remember
neurologist, UC Berkeley, really fantastic scientist person,
name Bob Knight, may know him. remember he, went
asked, know, "What process someone" "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?" said, "Listen, don't want anything" "or engage
routine way" "that can't keep consistently" "for least five ideally 6
days per week." thought, "Oh, pretty good." said, "Every 4 5 years"
"you might update that," "but need decide can consistently,"
"what can every day least six days week," "or 5 days week."
useful fits well notion habit slips,
happen screw not able engage whatever habits trying learn
whatever reason, next day, just get right back horse,
speak. However, really interesting feature neuroscience literature
psychology says chunking 21 days 2 day bins can
very, useful. true unit day cells use circadian
one, 24-hour clock, seem something powerful engaging
particular habits, particular sequence, two days row, resetting,
thinking, "Okay can day" "and can day," "I can probably
2 days." resetting. every 2 days resetting. kind
chunking 21 days series 2 day bins, trying perform 4 5
new habits completing 21 days. Now, everything described
21-day program 6 things trying new habits performing
4 5 not compensating, et cetera. nothing neuroscientifically unique
it, except fact not just 21 days, broken two day chunks. 21


days, stop engaging 21-day deliberate 4 5 things per day, tight schedule,
simply go autopilot. ask many particular habits
deliberately trying learn previous 21 days automatically
incorporated schedule? many naturally doing? words,
every 21 days don't update start adding new habits. simply try maintain
ones built first 21 days. think extremely important
habit literature find, sure, lot psychological
data neuroscience data, behavioral science data around form
habit, break habit. even kind test whether not
habit really achieved context independence, whether not strongly
formed habit. wasn't lot information, least search,
formed habit, evaluate whether not habit likely
persist long future. idea, set 6 things
like learn, like acquire life, habits, expect
going perform 4 5 day, 21 days. Again, miss
day, just hop right back next day. However, think
functional units within 21 day period 2 days. can try nail 4 5
things 2 days. happen get 6, great, not necessarily required.
can 2 days reset 2 days, reset 2 days, next 21
days, not trying acquire new habits, not going throw 6
habits want learn, simply going assess well, deeply,
rewired nervous system able perform 6 habits previous 21
days. extremely useful, believe, will allow asses whether
not can indeed make room, even room, say, habits.
Many people trying cram many new behaviors nervous system,
don't stand chance learning behaviors. may find,
kept 2 things consistently throughout 21 days. perhaps
one sporadically, 3 others that, frankly,
didn't manage execute. may also one people, one mutants,
sets 6 new things per day 21 days performs every single one
them. Terrific. power you. case, following 21 days, see
whether not can continue perform 6 things every day 21
days, then, then, want add habits in.
repeat 21 day process, know, 21 days new habit, 21 days testing


new habits whether not reflexive not. forever,
wanted. idea isn't something year long.
perhaps starting new year regardless listening this,
set make 21 day really stimulus period habits get wired
following month, maybe even following months, periods 21 days,
really kind thermometer test bed well embedded
particular habits. indeed want continue add new habits find
certain habits weren't able embed nervous system make

6 habits reflexive, move forward. think sort system,

nothing holy system. particular system number features,

adaptable real world. think one that, provided obey phase one,

programs one another, hopefully will easy, based descriptions
given. Well, that, think high probability habits
try form will achieve context dependence

01:28:26 Breaking Habits: Long-Term (Synaptic) Depression

will take progressively less limbic friction try perform them. Thus far,
almost exclusively discussing form habits. breaking
habits? Certainly many people like break habits feel don't
serve well. One challenges breaking habits many habits occur very,
quickly isn't opportunity intervene habit already
initiated cases completed. Well, couple tools
neuroscience psychology tell us can beneficial. things
somewhat intuitive relate call foundation practices. Meaning things set
overall tone body brain, less likely engage
particular habit raise level awareness, situation


feel inside. things like stress reduction. Things like getting good sleep.
Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout
day. those, course, will support trying break particular habits.
can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral
level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.
beautiful meta-analysis, involves looking number different studies
together, comparing statistical strength studies, looking
different conditions sorts habits trying made broken. first
author review Fritz, F R T Z. certainly put link this. Heather Fritz
"Intervention modify habits: scoping review." indeed broad
scale review. Journal Occupation Participation Health. published
2020. really nice article. couple things learned article

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing

recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad

start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch

particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

thing took review finding notifications either engage

effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric

engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor

so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start

loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior

able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional

fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted

level, especially interesting. way one is, say instance,
habit picking phone mid work session. Okay? reflexive
habit think people experienced. often hear idea that, oh,
phone filled access dopamine incredible things just drawn
it. noticed happened phone use time, people, including
sometimes admit, find just looking phone, find
particular app without actually engaged conscious set steps of, "Oh
really curious" "what's going particular app." "I'm really curious" "what's going
particular website." just kind "find yourself", air quotes,
listening, making air quotes. just sort find
behavior picking phone sort reflexive, become fully reflexive.
see lot meals multiple people no one's looking
phone sudden someone takes phone notice
people just naturally take phone. kind observation induced reflex.
wager people aren't consciously aware immediate steps
involved. literature says number ways break sorts
habitual behaviors, reflexive behaviors. approaches involve establishing
sort reward not performing activity sort punishment
forming activity. heard basic things people will do, like
even put like rubber band wrist, every time complain, every time
behavior, like pick phone, give snap
wrist. yeah, rationale trying create somatic,
physical representation something makes real harder overlook.
people will just tick mark piece paper. sort of, "What gets
measured gets managed" kind mindset, every time something,
take away judgment, new age-y, realize, find
there, search literature. Even PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
every time engage behavior, just measure fact
behavior, just mark down. end day, people supposed look
say, "Oh goodness!" "I can't believe spent, know, 3 hours." Or, "I
46 times." fact, lot apps, social media apps, will start give
warnings now, opt in, app hour, like
leave? people just click right past go back in. think people say, "Oh


goodness!" "It's hour therefor right," "I absolutely shouldn't
engage more." just far easy just blow past reminders. Well,
literature habit formation habit reduction, breaking habits, analyzed.

01:35:49 Notifications Don’t Work

get specific tool breaking habits. Perhaps interesting
thing took review finding notifications either engage
habits not engage habits actually not effective time.
effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever
whatever." just visual reminders, physical reminders electronic reminders
effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
completely enough punish completely enough, break
behavior. words, punishment isn't bad enough, order break habit,
just speaks powerful habits become reflexive.


just very, hard override. turns key generating long term
depression pathways actually take period immediately following bad
habit execution, meaning, say tell not going pick
phone, not going bite nails, not going reflexively walk
refrigerator particular time day,

01:37:50 Tool 6: Break Bad Habits Post-Bad-Habit “Positive Cargo”

find anyway, actually happen bringing
conscious awareness period immediately afterwards, think people
recognize, realize "Ugh just again. just again." moment,
capture sequence events, not led bad habit execution, actually
take advantage fact neurons responsible generating bad
habit active moment ago, actually engage replacement behavior
immediately afterward. Now, really interesting think powerful
thought engage replacement behavior truly
replaces bad habit behavior, right? able identify
state mind sequence events leading bad habit, rather, stage
period immediately bad habit execution, unique opportunity insert
different type of, call adaptive behavior, behavior
not line bad behavior, give example. say find
yourself, trying focused work, pick phone, disappointed
picking phone, course just put down, re-
engage work behavior, good that, probably wouldn't
done first place. so, turns effective, go
engage positive habit. Now, two major effects. first one
start link time execution bad behavior good behavior.
so, start recruit neural circuits, neurons, can start
somewhat dismantle sequence firing associated bad behavior.
words, start create kind double habit starts bad habit,
ends good habit. seems create enough temporal mismatch
recognizing heading toward bad habit becomes apparent
you. again, want make very, concrete. say behavior
reflexively picking one's phone. that, think, "Ugh, goodness,


again." going do, set engage
positive behavior, deemed positive. here,
subjective, hard give example will necessarily make sense
everybody, perhaps working hydration, maybe go glass
water. Maybe trying breath work something. Maybe trying
enhance language speaking skills go spend 5 minutes
particular type language learning. literally exit whatever
perform new positive habit immediate period right that, even
short period time. little bit counterintuitive, creates kind
cognitive temporal mismatch initial bad behavior,
call sort closed loop, engineers will know
talking about. closed loop, one behavior, one set neural firings, leads
another, leads another, just kind sets thing motion. can
kind self perpetuating system. changing number features
loop, disrupts closed nature loop, creates call open loop,
open loop, better able intervene. So, mentioned before, might
seem counterintuitive, might think, "Why want reward execution
bad habit" "with good habit." "I don't want reward bad habit." really
trying trying change nature neural circuits
firing can rewrite script bad habit. different way put
be, imagine bad habit like chord piano play, chord
notes, sequence notes play, comes easily. can
play every single time. But, say, trying learn new piece music,
just constantly inserting inappropriate time. was, know, think
decent enough analogy bad habit involves motor
execution. just find it. Rather trying prevent
it, next time it, add new chord sequence trying
learn. changes whole nature sequence neurons
firing bad habit end newly applied good habit. So,
way start dismantle or, say dismantle, really weaken
likelihood neuron fires, neuron B will fire. Because, starting off
mode reflexively performing bad habit, neurons firing together without
consciously aware it. almost impossible intervene
without number features, like severe punishment, severe consequence type


outcomes. Rather, tacking additional sequences, like neuron A, neuron B
fires, saying, "Okay well, neuron B fires," "I'm going start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F fire." Right? the, C, D, E, F positive behavior
going insert. so, create chain neuronal activation
easy dismantle. so, people applied kind approach,
removes need constant conscious awareness one's behavior prior
behavior, very, difficult achieve. Rather, find
able engage re-mapping neural circuits associated bad habits ways
very, straightforward. Right? can always identify
done thing don't want tack something additional
positive. Now, nature positive thing important. don't want
something hard execute. want something positive
fairly easy execute, not struggling time insert top
bad behavior, whatever bad behavior might happen be. again, rooted
biology long term depression, maps well behavioral change
literature able glean really shows rather just get reminders,
rather try instill punishment, rather setting reward breaking bad
habits, perhaps simplest way approach tack additional behaviors
bad habits, make sure behaviors good behaviors, behaviors
adaptive you, so, will soon find initiation bad habit

Things like quality nutrition. Things like positive routines arranged throughout

can useful, admittedly generic advice. doesn't point
one specific protocol. order identify specific protocol one apply order
break habits, look mirror image sort neuroplasticity
talked beginning episode. beginning episode, talked
form neuroplasticity called long term potentiation, involving NMDA
receptor. Just refresh memory little bit, says set neurons
electrically active likely neurons will communicate
easily changes things like NMDA receptor activity, recruitment
additional receptors, et cetera. essentially cellular molecular explanation
something goes unlearned, learned, reflexive. Now, order break
synapses, break apart neural connections serving habit don't
want engage in, need engage process called long term depression.
long term depression nothing state mental depression reduction
mood. really want clear say depression context
nothing psychological depression, nothing mood. simply
called long term depression just long term potentiation says neuron
triggers firing neuron B, robustly again,
neuron will not fire intensely, frequently, order activate
neuron B future become potentiated. Right? threshold co-
activation reduced. much higher probability will activated
together low levels intensity. essentially long term potentiation is. Long
term depression says neuron active neuron B not active within
particular time window, connection neuron B will weaken
time, even started off strongly connected. Okay? So, going repeat
pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism whereby neuron A,
neuron B active, different time outside particular, call, temporal
window, meaning outside particular time window, long term depression,
connection neuron neuron B will weaken. just point
interest, NMDA receptor also involved long term depression, although
molecular components involved well. take two neurons
underlie habit synchrony? get fire asynchronously?


pretty interesting respect cellular molecular biology, behavioral

effective immediate period people started using notifications,
little sticky notes, like, "Don't go refrigerator" "between hours whatever

effective immediate term, long term, not predict whether not
people effectively stick habits trying stick to, break habits
trying break. sadly, doesn't seem work well. perhaps
just need come robust reminders. don't know, mild electric shock
something like know, sort kidding mild electric
shock, know human animal studies things like
electric shock, things like monetary penalties, right? pay every time
engage particular behavior. pretty effective ways break habits.
problems people not monitored habit use, instance, can
imagine situation say, "I'm not going pick phone" "for 4 hours
early part day" "so can get, know, real dedicated focused work done."
Unless someone's monitoring them, people don't tend monitor
