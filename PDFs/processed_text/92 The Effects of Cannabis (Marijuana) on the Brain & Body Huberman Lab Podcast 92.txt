talked many times Huberman Lab Podcast Non-Sleep Deep Rest,
AKA, NSDR. NSDR sort umbrella term variety different practices,
behavioral practices allow direct brain body
particular state, typically, state one deep relaxation, also one
can access bodily brain systems teaching relax
real time recover sleep may not getting night,

00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk cannabis, refer
cannabis, indeed referring marijuana marijuana plant. Now, cannabis
plants come different strains different varieties, different strains


indeed different genetic strains. just animals humans different genetic
backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns


extremely important

get five free travel packs year's supply vitamin D3 K2. Okay,
somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System
Function

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now
effects CB1 receptor occupied THC occupied CBD, not
nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk
sorts problems. again, feel obligated say, not saying
don't ingest cannabis THC CBD. not saying. saying
evaluate potency technical terms, affinity
compounds, THC CBD CBN, bind endogenous receptors,
like howitzer gun, like cannon going off, compared endogenous
cannabinoid, whether not EAE 2-AG, like cap gun level
activation, least analogy. now least like think


fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad
sweep, different biological effects can have,

00:53:07 Biological Effects Cannabis

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue
around brain body going harbor THC molecule CBD
molecule quite long while, least 80 days. So, someone smokes cannabis
ingest cannabis, rapidly gets bloodstream, components
psychoactive get bloodstream immediately able access neurons
cells start effects

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally

inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-

THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts

common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look

somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly

00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk cannabis, refer
cannabis, indeed referring marijuana marijuana plant. Now, cannabis
plants come different strains different varieties, different strains


indeed different genetic strains. just animals humans different genetic
backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also

endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,

everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now

nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk

fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad
sweep, different biological effects can have,

00:53:07 Biological Effects Cannabis

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue
around brain body going harbor THC molecule CBD

ingest cannabis, rapidly gets bloodstream, components
psychoactive get bloodstream immediately able access neurons
cells start effects

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest
varieties cannabis. talk paranoid effect occurs
might predict occur little bit. just want give sense
working, mentioned before, THC and/or CBD going bind
CB1 receptor, say prefrontal cortex, neurons prefrontal cortex,
going bind there, retrograde signaling back presynaptic

transmission, increasing release neurotransmitter prefrontal cortex.
However, time, THC CBD brought
system binding type receptors, CB1 receptors, brain
structures, amygdala causing retrograde signaling back
presynaptic neurons amygdala, quieting activation neurons,
interesting. compounds, THC and/or CBD, brought

causing suppression circuitries. kind seesaw effect
compound increasing mood alertness focus prefrontal cortex
decreasing stress threat detection amygdala, one
reasons why, especially sativa varieties cannabis, allow people enter


states focus, might even say flow, although don't want go flow
states really are. different discussion, poorly defined is.
certainly don't want give people impression cannabis increases flow
states, not always case, certainly often not going
case. idea molecule comes brain shifting
everything towards state focus, elevated mood heightened sense importance
whatever happen doing. now course, whatever
happen writing song, writing poetry, communicating
somebody, also something trivial watching cartoons watching
movie, not trivial right, terms thinking creative
aspects creativity stimulating aspects cannabis, not productivity oriented.
narrowed focus, elevated mood, relaxed yet energetic, major effects
sativa varieties, except, really big boldface, triple underlined 'except,'
except individuals, depending dosage, also depending preexisting
neural circuitry propensity anxiety, people ingest smoke sativa varieties,
regardless whether not type one, type two type three variety,

interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set

not just important males, course. However, studies say cannabis
not decrease testosterone, seems depend whether not cannabis

whether not cannabis used chronically individual acutely.
just want zoom say studies cannabis drugs kind humans
really complicated. think it, someone come laboratory,
say want study chronic cannabis use. Well, can't keep
laboratory time, rely self-report often use
cannabis form, can't really control one individual next
much cannabis THC bringing system. One person might

course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis

present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really

even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-

cascades events lot opportunity regulation, adjustment. Receptor
systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system

potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery

go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among
individuals 16 24 years old. fact, individuals 16 24 years old,
particular, students people working, surprising, unemployed
populations, young, 16 24, least young, student
working doubles likelihood somebody going use cannabis regular
basis, twice per week. typical age initiating cannabis use nowadays
19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within
cells data point creating much, much higher likelihood
developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis
use, signaling mechanisms involved predisposing
individuals psychosis later life. look individuals start using cannabis,
even younger, age 14, even young 12, probability psychosis later life,
particular schizophrenic schizophrenic-like episodes doubles,
really serious concern, completely aside so-called positive effects

2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,

"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also

endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,

describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1

Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens

lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest

opposite direction, just give example that. just mentioned
people smoke eat sativa, tends lead one specific set, generally leads
one specific set effects, heightened focus, mood, et cetera. Whereas

harder gauge smokeable forms cannabis, especially
smokeable forms cannabis obtained sources isn't lot

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,

vape tobacco cannabis, severely impairing function endothelial cells
make capillaries blood vessels brain body, known
decrease cognitive capacity time, increase probability strokes, severely impact
lung function, also lead things like peripheral neuropathies. leads sexual
dysfunction, lack blood flow genitals, can lead aspects
reproductive damage, including ovaries testes. Essentially, no
way state it, except smoking vaping negative health consequences
independent substances people trying get bloodstream
smoking vaping. people smoke vape tobacco, people smoke vape
cannabis, cases, just set aside direct effects tobacco
direct effects cannabis, can confidently say process smoking,
inhaling smoke lungs, yes, also vaping, bringing chemicals transport
nicotine, case, cannabis, lungs way vaping severely
detrimental endothelial cells. think years ago, vaping wasn't
prominent, question idea maybe vaping going far
healthier least not bad smoking, now can see huge number
negative health effects vaping, distinct effects smoking.
like information smoking versus vaping, please see episode
nicotine. will also entire episode vaping future,
really no way slice dice candy coat it. fact matter
smoking clear severe negative health consequences, regardless whether
not smoking tobacco cannabis, THC, vaping negative health
consequences, whether not using vape bring nicotine



02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural
Development

THC combination THC CBD. simply way is.
said, now like focus attention direct effects cannabis has, either
way THC action way CBD action terms positive negative health effects
brain body, going explore first function age.
reason going related fact mentioned beginning
episode, CB1 CB2 receptors, two receptors cannabis
THC CBD CBN psychoactive compounds cannabis bind
actions present throughout development. Believe not,
present soon conception, CB1 CB2 receptors actually play
critical role development fetus. Now, might wonder is,
course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis
exposed cannabis THC CBD. But, recall, endogenous cannabinoids
present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really
interesting. means endogenous cannabinoids activation CB1
CB2 receptors integral part neural development, going
become especially relevant considering whether not pregnant mothers
not use cannabis CBD, also points interesting biology
terms brain develops body develops. Now development
brain nervous system body fascinating vast literature, certainly far
vast cover today's episode, especially late hour were, will
future episode brain development. terms effects cannabis,
sufficient say cannabinoid receptors present active developing
fetus. present active newborn. present active
adolescence. across time, conception adolescence, endogenous
cannabinoids mainly responsible actions cannabinoid receptors.
time, cannabinoid receptors specific effects
distinct effects later life, effects can largely explained terms
neural development. Again, don't time entire lecture now,


development, body collection bunch cells. actually called
blastula, means ball cells, cells actually grow
connections duplicate themselves, interesting process
neurons initially situated far apart, grow connections make
contacts one another. remove certain connections, depending kind
life events exposed to. wonderful event early life traumatic
early life, connections change, et cetera. important point today's
discussion CB1 receptor, particular, expressed every neuron
developing brain shown important every aspect neural
development, proliferation cells, meaning getting enough cells create
brain, outgrowth so-called axons, little wires connect neurons
one another, steering, direction axons go development,
essential, even far explain connections form
neurons, so-called synapses, synapses work. basic
statement endogenous cannabinoids CB1 receptor activation critical
every aspect brain wiring development. mind, statement
make absolutely terrifying, least me, frankly, terrifying
well. statement is, current statistics cannabis use pregnant
mothers absolutely shocking. recent survey pregnant mothers
United States show 15%, one-five, 15% pregnant mothers report using cannabis
form another, either smoking likely ingestion edible,
aware negative effects smoking developing fetus, ingestion
edible increase THC and/or CBD pregnancy, me, say,
developmental neurobiologist is, frankly, scary. absolutely scary,
CB1 receptor not just minor player neural development. absolutely central
every critical aspect brain wiring development. Now, long-term implications
even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use
cannabis point pregnancy not yet known. is, say,
experiment ongoing. remiss didn't point data just
implore you, please, please, please, pregnant considering getting pregnant,
cannabis user, whether not using edibles, CBD user, please
whatever necessary not ingest cannabis smoke cannabis ingest CBD
pregnancy. Now, may certain clinical indications physician
OB/GYN, pediatrician will eventually pediatrician


child will prescribe CBD, although hard imagine are. contacted
number different pediatricians OB/GYNs not single one said
ever suggest, fact strongly discourage patients using cannabis
pregnancy. think advent edible forms cannabis,
combination THC CBD certain products, fact people view
CBD safer, not include, not have, say,
psychoactive effects THC does, led situation 15%
pregnant mothers using cannabis point pregnancy maybe even
frequently throughout pregnancy, effects developing fetus completely
unknown. recall cannabis THC CBD outcompete, meaning park
receptor endogenous cannabinoids prevent endogenous cannabinoids
normal level pattern action, absolutely critical. cannot
encourage enough, rather, say, cannot discourage enough use
cannabis related compounds cannabis, edible smoked, certainly not
smoked, even edible pregnancy, certainly breastfeeding, lactating
mothers, also true. Recall cannabis THC CBD incredibly
lipophilic. fat soluble, get cells readily, cross
blood brain barrier. cross blood placental barrier. encountered
statistic, kind wipe eyes times. not believe it, yet
crosschecked number studies. others come little bit
lower somewhere like 13% 14%, come little bit higher,
average 15% striking shocking, don't know make message
clear. hope clear. Please not use cannabis, THC

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-
coupled receptor, like bucket brigade kick off process
one molecule handed off another molecule handed off
another molecule. long chain cascade events. long chains
cascades events lot opportunity regulation, adjustment. Receptor
systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system
used tickled, not punched, tickled endogenous cannabinoids, every
binds, effect, certainly not bound incredible
potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery
smoking vaping vaping edible edible transdermal. Anyway,
go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among
individuals 16 24 years old. fact, individuals 16 24 years old,
particular, students people working, surprising, unemployed
populations, young, 16 24, least young, student
working doubles likelihood somebody going use cannabis regular
basis, twice per week. typical age initiating cannabis use nowadays
19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within
cells data point creating much, much higher likelihood
developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis
use, signaling mechanisms involved predisposing
individuals psychosis later life. look individuals start using cannabis,
even younger, age 14, even young 12, probability psychosis later life,
particular schizophrenic schizophrenic-like episodes doubles,
really serious concern, completely aside so-called positive effects

unlike lot drugs, rate cannabis use strongly related dangerous
people perceive cannabis be. Now, might seem obvious, one hand,
think something very, dangerous, expect probability

talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people
starting use cannabis age bracket 16 24. Many
functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use
age bracket 16 24, twice likely use individuals start using
cannabis individuals. Plus, general perception there,
way cannabis discussed media sports figures celebrities

00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk cannabis, refer
cannabis, indeed referring marijuana marijuana plant. Now, cannabis
plants come different strains different varieties, different strains


indeed different genetic strains. just animals humans different genetic
backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns


extremely important

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk

endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar

world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change

cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not

consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor

selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk cannabis, refer
cannabis, indeed referring marijuana marijuana plant. Now, cannabis
plants come different strains different varieties, different strains


indeed different genetic strains. just animals humans different genetic
backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous

everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time

describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth

receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going

postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication

nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling

vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people

probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,

that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different

something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties

brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings

THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally

order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple

whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether

not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

circumstances, aren't just hearing cannabis safe, not
just implied cannabis safer, many people talking

cannabis. realize saying going upset people there,
know number people fought hard legalization
process, want acknowledge that. also want acknowledge many known

issue whether not cannabis safe developing brain body. Again,
not demonizing anybody using cannabis, want make point simply
directly. far away different circumstance brain individual
25 years older using cannabis whatever form, occasionally maybe
even frequently, young person, aged 14 25, using cannabis, either

human being, one portion becoming functional human being, certainly
essential one. relies fine tuning neural circuitry
talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

indeed different genetic strains. just animals humans different genetic
backgrounds, can crossed one another yield genetic variation
offspring, plants can hybridized one another various ways grafting
use different types seed combinations, et cetera, order generate
different strains. also naturally occurring differences strains plants,
cannabis plant no exception. instance, context discussion
cannabis medicinal uses recreational uses, need distinguish
sativa variety, indica variety, variety called ruderalis not often
discussed, hybrids sativa, indica ruderalis. diving different
strains cannabis impact brain embody, similarly differently,
want emphasize cannabis plant contains number different psychoactive
compounds. Now, powerful compounds THC. technical name
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC, refer it, just one
psychoactive biologically active compounds within cannabis plants. also
CBD, technically referred cannabidiol, cannabidiol, CBD, known
used things like pain management, anxiety management medicinal
purposes. will talk efficacy CBD purposes, well of,
believe not, dangers CBD, depending sourced
dosage, et cetera. got THC, CBD also CBN cannabinol. CBN less
often discussed. going hear lot less CBN containing products
there, CBN containing medicines, relevant today's discussion, will come
bit. Now, will sure provide specificity say,
broadly speaking, THC largely responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
changes mood, changes bodily state sensation, et cetera.
Whereas CBD extent, CBN, profound effects brain body,
don't tend give people sensation altered perception, altered mood, et
cetera. people might say not component cannabis that, quote
unquote, gets high, although today, will really drill high
represents terms chemical systems brain body. will soon learn
think high actually includes number different changes
brain body, can best explained CBD, not THC,
runs counter people know believe. broadly speaking,
THC, CBD CBN. want point cannabis plant 70,
seven-zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds, many still not


studied isolation detail. big future research cannabis
THC THC-related psychoactive compounds, well CBD CBN. Today
mainly going focus THC CBD, mentioned before. also point
cannabis plant 400 biologically active compounds.
biologically active compounds may may not psychoactive properties,
may may not useful pain relief, et cetera. Again, vast landscape
exploration cannabis plant hemp include
beneficial us detrimental us, again, lot work do. Today, going
really try stay target already know certain
exciting mysteries intriguing mysteries

00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects

explore more. will certainly highlight those. go back
different strains cannabis plant, sativa, indica ruderalis explore
differentially impacts brain body, therein think can start
learn lot incredible plant cannabis plant. whether not
user cannabis whether not entirely opposed cannabis use,
understanding cannabis works brain body, itself, absolutely fascinating
can teach lot brain body work basic level can tell
lot brain body will react different life events
mood established stabilized, appetite established stabilized
on. three major strains cannabis, sativa, indica ruderalis.
sake today's conversation, can pretty much cross off ruderalis. not
often consumed, components ruderalis not often consumed medicinal
recreational purposes. focus sativa indica. People will consume sativa
variety cannabis either edible smoking cannabis, will consume
indica variety cannabis, edible smoking cannabis, sometimes
will take transdermal form sublingual form. bunch different
ways get cannabis body, clear distinction sativa
indica actually shows first structure plant. extremes, meaning
pure strain sativa, tends taller plant, longer stock, believe not,
actually length leaves quite bit longer, whereas indica plant tends
short stout. And, aficionados there, sure know lot


specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns


extremely important

get five free travel packs year's supply vitamin D3 K2. Okay,
somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System
Function

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now
effects CB1 receptor occupied THC occupied CBD, not
nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk
sorts problems. again, feel obligated say, not saying
don't ingest cannabis THC CBD. not saying. saying
evaluate potency technical terms, affinity
compounds, THC CBD CBN, bind endogenous receptors,
like howitzer gun, like cannon going off, compared endogenous
cannabinoid, whether not EAE 2-AG, like cap gun level
activation, least analogy. now least like think


fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad
sweep, different biological effects can have,

00:53:07 Biological Effects Cannabis

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue
around brain body going harbor THC molecule CBD
molecule quite long while, least 80 days. So, someone smokes cannabis
ingest cannabis, rapidly gets bloodstream, components
psychoactive get bloodstream immediately able access neurons
cells start effects

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching

interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set

again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin

set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope

air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns


extremely important

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also

endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,

everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1

Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens

lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days

just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest

harder gauge smokeable forms cannabis, especially
smokeable forms cannabis obtained sources isn't lot

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,

away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.

said this, think that, braiding trying get

typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can

involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity

don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain

influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence

brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled

cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly

selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering

specific features sativa versus indica, already talking
plant, cannabis, two different morphologies shapes. might say,
"Well, interesting important "to affects affects people "for
medicinal recreational purposes?" Well, turns even though
plant, two different genetic varieties, way grow
way capture sunlight way, believe not, different plants
within strain interact one another, 'cause believe not, plants interacting
one another, actually bring different elements psychoactive compounds
different components within leaves so-called buds. takeaway
consumed, say consumed, want clear, don't necessarily
just mean oral consumption eating cannabis sativa edible, also mean smoking it,
be... people will, just like tobacco, way bring
psychoactive components bloodstream brain body
essentially heat dried leaves cannabis plant. heat liberates
psychoactive components inhaled lungs, lungs
include lot vasculature, lot basically blood vessels capillaries,
psychoactive components actually directly absorbed lungs
bloodstream, can cross bloodstream permeate throughout
body cross so-called blood brain barrier. words, burning plant
liberates smoke contains psychoactive compounds, inhaled
lungs get brain body act brain body.
major effect sativa varieties create high, will, putting
air quotes listening, also act stimulant. sativa
varieties tend make people feel invigorated, somewhat alert. doesn't tend
much sedative varieties. people report heightened
sense focus heightened sense creativity. talk little bit later
whether not actually achieving heightened levels focus creativity,
whether not just perceive heightened levels focus
creativity. sativa varieties tend make people feel little bit less susceptible pain
noxious stimuli, basically stimuli don't like. sativa varieties
often prescribed used recreational context pain management
relief. Basically, sativa variety known include head biased effect. here,
talking subjective effects, course will vary one individual
next. people will smoke cannabis sativa ingest cannabis sativa orally


will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire

synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call

bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic

talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis

later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term

depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,
recreational use medicinal use, undergo pretty profound changes way
speak, specific set ways. Now, first all, changes speech
shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain

changes one's speech specific way. study Adam

can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating

shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

will feel entirely different array effects, people, majority people
experience head-centered high, alertness, focus sense
creative. Contrast indica varieties cannabis, people smoke
eat ingest indica varieties, psychoactive components indica, again,
pure indica, not hybridized sativa all, just pure indica, tend lead
full-bodied effects. People report feeling complete, full-body relaxation,
sedative effect. Indica cannabis often prescribed and/or used recreationally order
achieve state sleep help relieve anxiety, less stimulant effect.
will talk why, literally, underlying neural circuits lead sativa variety
causing elevated mood head high, will, indica variety
full body relaxation. One ways remember distinction
effects cannabis sativa cannabis indica relayed friend
actually chronic, meaning every day, day, consumer marijuana. basically
smoked marijuana 20 years quitting four five years ago, said
indica often referred 'in-da-couch,' meaning laid back couch.
can help remember indica varieties cannabis

00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains

tend sedative effects. Okay, sativa indica,
now hybrid strains. marijuana growers people specialize
creating novel varieties cannabis plant, again, using words cannabis
marijuana less interchangeably here, good creating new strains
plant might 25% sativa 75% indica vice versa, 50/50 90/10.
Essentially, happening nowadays plant biology, plant genetics,
say, growers getting quite efficient creating variety different strains
marijuana plant give rise nuanced distinct effects brain body.
fact, much so, now new nomenclature, new language emerging
around cannabis development novel strains cannabis medicinal and/or
recreational purposes. might sound little bit medical little bit clinical
people, believe not, nomenclature now typically used.
People still refer sativa, indica hybrid strains, now also
description so-called type one, type two type three strains given sativa,
indica hybrid strain. Okay, just put clearly mind, got sativa


varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns


extremely important

somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System
Function

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now
effects CB1 receptor occupied THC occupied CBD, not
nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk
sorts problems. again, feel obligated say, not saying
don't ingest cannabis THC CBD. not saying. saying
evaluate potency technical terms, affinity
compounds, THC CBD CBN, bind endogenous receptors,
like howitzer gun, like cannon going off, compared endogenous

fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad
sweep, different biological effects can have,

00:53:07 Biological Effects Cannabis

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue

ingest cannabis, rapidly gets bloodstream, components
psychoactive get bloodstream immediately able access neurons

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest
varieties cannabis. talk paranoid effect occurs
might predict occur little bit. just want give sense
working, mentioned before, THC and/or CBD going bind

However, time, THC CBD brought

reasons why, especially sativa varieties cannabis, allow people enter

certainly don't want give people impression cannabis increases flow

sativa varieties, except, really big boldface, triple underlined 'except,'
except individuals, depending dosage, also depending preexisting

regardless whether not type one, type two type three variety,

simply not case. Now, can say sure general categories

areas like prefrontal cortex. Now, unlike compounds like nicotine alcohol
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine, talk cannabinoid system,
say effects, biological effects, psychoactive effects, want keep mind
always, please, please, please keep mind effects can varied often
opposite direction, just give example that. just mentioned
people smoke eat sativa, tends lead one specific set, generally leads
one specific set effects, heightened focus, mood, et cetera. Whereas
ingest smoke indica components, again, still talking THC CBD
varying ratios, now indica cannabis, say, "Well, improve
transition time sleep?" least give people impression improves
transition time sleep. talk indica actually sleep little bit,
indica also tends suppress activation amygdala threat detection centers

fact dosing THC CBD can fairly straightforward form edibles,
can be, least controlled source, defined number milligrams
THC, defined number milligrams CBD. true ingestibles. much
harder gauge smokeable forms cannabis, especially
smokeable forms cannabis obtained sources isn't lot
clear information total amount THC product. Now, changing
quite lot nowadays commercialization THC CBD products
cannabis number different areas, including United States. still, many
people ingesting cannabis, THC, CBD sources don't really know
much bringing system. so, whether not someone gets
incredible anxiety relief, enhanced sense mood focus wellbeing, pain relief, et
cetera, whether not full blown panic attacks, et cetera, hard
predict based dosage information alone. Now, course, can create broad
categories, going talk studies create broad categories low
dose, moderate dose, high dose. frequent use infrequent use, unlike
alcohol, unlike nicotine, can't really point specificity X amount alcohol, grams
alcohol per week, safe, X amount alcohol, not safe.
know lot people wondering, often can smoke cannabis,
often can eat cannabis THC CBD number different forms

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set

again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

reproductive damage, including ovaries testes. Essentially, no
way state it, except smoking vaping negative health consequences
independent substances people trying get bloodstream
smoking vaping. people smoke vape tobacco, people smoke vape
cannabis, cases, just set aside direct effects tobacco
direct effects cannabis, can confidently say process smoking,
inhaling smoke lungs, yes, also vaping, bringing chemicals transport
nicotine, case, cannabis, lungs way vaping severely
detrimental endothelial cells. think years ago, vaping wasn't
prominent, question idea maybe vaping going far
healthier least not bad smoking, now can see huge number
negative health effects vaping, distinct effects smoking.
like information smoking versus vaping, please see episode
nicotine. will also entire episode vaping future,
really no way slice dice candy coat it. fact matter
smoking clear severe negative health consequences, regardless whether
not smoking tobacco cannabis, THC, vaping negative health
consequences, whether not using vape bring nicotine



02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural
Development

THC combination THC CBD. simply way is.
said, now like focus attention direct effects cannabis has, either
way THC action way CBD action terms positive negative health effects
brain body, going explore first function age.
reason going related fact mentioned beginning
episode, CB1 CB2 receptors, two receptors cannabis
THC CBD CBN psychoactive compounds cannabis bind
actions present throughout development. Believe not,
present soon conception, CB1 CB2 receptors actually play
critical role development fetus. Now, might wonder is,
course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis
exposed cannabis THC CBD. But, recall, endogenous cannabinoids
present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really
interesting. means endogenous cannabinoids activation CB1
CB2 receptors integral part neural development, going
become especially relevant considering whether not pregnant mothers
not use cannabis CBD, also points interesting biology
terms brain develops body develops. Now development
brain nervous system body fascinating vast literature, certainly far
vast cover today's episode, especially late hour were, will
future episode brain development. terms effects cannabis,
sufficient say cannabinoid receptors present active developing
fetus. present active newborn. present active
adolescence. across time, conception adolescence, endogenous
cannabinoids mainly responsible actions cannabinoid receptors.
time, cannabinoid receptors specific effects
distinct effects later life, effects can largely explained terms
neural development. Again, don't time entire lecture now,


development, body collection bunch cells. actually called
blastula, means ball cells, cells actually grow
connections duplicate themselves, interesting process
neurons initially situated far apart, grow connections make
contacts one another. remove certain connections, depending kind
life events exposed to. wonderful event early life traumatic
early life, connections change, et cetera. important point today's
discussion CB1 receptor, particular, expressed every neuron
developing brain shown important every aspect neural
development, proliferation cells, meaning getting enough cells create
brain, outgrowth so-called axons, little wires connect neurons
one another, steering, direction axons go development,
essential, even far explain connections form
neurons, so-called synapses, synapses work. basic
statement endogenous cannabinoids CB1 receptor activation critical
every aspect brain wiring development. mind, statement
make absolutely terrifying, least me, frankly, terrifying
well. statement is, current statistics cannabis use pregnant
mothers absolutely shocking. recent survey pregnant mothers
United States show 15%, one-five, 15% pregnant mothers report using cannabis
form another, either smoking likely ingestion edible,
aware negative effects smoking developing fetus, ingestion
edible increase THC and/or CBD pregnancy, me, say,
developmental neurobiologist is, frankly, scary. absolutely scary,
CB1 receptor not just minor player neural development. absolutely central
every critical aspect brain wiring development. Now, long-term implications
even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use
cannabis point pregnancy not yet known. is, say,
experiment ongoing. remiss didn't point data just
implore you, please, please, please, pregnant considering getting pregnant,
cannabis user, whether not using edibles, CBD user, please
whatever necessary not ingest cannabis smoke cannabis ingest CBD
pregnancy. Now, may certain clinical indications physician
OB/GYN, pediatrician will eventually pediatrician


child will prescribe CBD, although hard imagine are. contacted
number different pediatricians OB/GYNs not single one said
ever suggest, fact strongly discourage patients using cannabis
pregnancy. think advent edible forms cannabis,
combination THC CBD certain products, fact people view
CBD safer, not include, not have, say,
psychoactive effects THC does, led situation 15%
pregnant mothers using cannabis point pregnancy maybe even
frequently throughout pregnancy, effects developing fetus completely
unknown. recall cannabis THC CBD outcompete, meaning park
receptor endogenous cannabinoids prevent endogenous cannabinoids
normal level pattern action, absolutely critical. cannot
encourage enough, rather, say, cannot discourage enough use
cannabis related compounds cannabis, edible smoked, certainly not
smoked, even edible pregnancy, certainly breastfeeding, lactating
mothers, also true. Recall cannabis THC CBD incredibly
lipophilic. fat soluble, get cells readily, cross
blood brain barrier. cross blood placental barrier. encountered
statistic, kind wipe eyes times. not believe it, yet
crosschecked number studies. others come little bit
lower somewhere like 13% 14%, come little bit higher,
average 15% striking shocking, don't know make message
clear. hope clear. Please not use cannabis, THC

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-
coupled receptor, like bucket brigade kick off process
one molecule handed off another molecule handed off
another molecule. long chain cascade events. long chains
cascades events lot opportunity regulation, adjustment. Receptor
systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system
used tickled, not punched, tickled endogenous cannabinoids, every
binds, effect, certainly not bound incredible
potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery
smoking vaping vaping edible edible transdermal. Anyway,
go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among
individuals 16 24 years old. fact, individuals 16 24 years old,
particular, students people working, surprising, unemployed
populations, young, 16 24, least young, student
working doubles likelihood somebody going use cannabis regular
basis, twice per week. typical age initiating cannabis use nowadays
19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within
cells data point creating much, much higher likelihood
developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis
use, signaling mechanisms involved predisposing
individuals psychosis later life. look individuals start using cannabis,
even younger, age 14, even young 12, probability psychosis later life,
particular schizophrenic schizophrenic-like episodes doubles,

talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

varieties, pure sativa varieties. indica varieties, again, pure indica,
hybrid varieties, beneath those, type one, type two
type three strains indica, sativa hybrid varieties. type one, type two
type three? Well, type one, type two type three strains strains
varying amounts ratios THC CBD. instance, type one strain,
instance, pure sativa, type one, type one pure sativa type one
indica. going greatest amount THC relative CBD. really
want emphasize this, understanding ratio THC CBD can help explain lot
even predict lot given strain cannabis will impact somebody.
instance, THC largely responsible typical psychoactive components
cannabis, mean is, somebody's ingesting sativa, routinely makes
feel energized, elevates mood, gives heightened sense
creativity, experience, taking type one version that,
means quite rich THC little CBD. However, take
type one version sativa, feels far strong, like much energy, felt
like much head, nowadays, strains sativa
genetically engineered, don't mean engineer tinkering away gene
engineering CRISPR creating mutes, literally hybridizing, crossing different
plants one another, creating natural context, way plants outside
world sometimes hybridize one another, creating variety perhaps type
two, going less THC CBD, type three, going
high CBD little THC, also true indica varieties.
want make sure everyone understands this, becomes
important understanding biology cannabis predicting positive versus
negative effects cannabis. Sativa stimulant-like effect tends
head high, will. Indica tends full-body, lead in-da-couch,
refer before, pun intended, deep relaxation, reduce insomnia, et cetera. Now,
within sativa indica, type one, type two type three,
everything much THC, dominant psychoactive
compound, versus CBD, effects, mainly body, not much
brain modes thinking mood, et cetera, much THC versus CBD
present. again, type one THC dominant, type two, equal ratios, will, THC
CBD, type three tend high CBD. Okay, already got
categorization hopefully isn't overwhelming you, turns

CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call

bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic

talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis

later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings

interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed

strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain

changes one's speech specific way. study Adam
Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether

not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

get five free travel packs year's supply vitamin D3 K2. Okay,
somewhat surprisingly, going set aside cannabis. going take
know sativa, indica, type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera, just
going set aside moment. that? Well, ask
ourselves, plants, compounds, THC,
CBD, sativa, indica, et cetera, effect us all?
discussion much resembles discussion
previous episode nicotine, many know, nicotine
commonly used substance. fact, look three commonly used
drugs, alcohol will top list. Many billions people regularly use alcohol


occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System
Function

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now
effects CB1 receptor occupied THC occupied CBD, not
nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk

fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,

four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest

harder gauge smokeable forms cannabis, especially
smokeable forms cannabis obtained sources isn't lot

us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,

away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say

rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

occasionally use alcohol. Many billions people also use nicotine. second
consumed drug, 1 billion probably closer 2 billion people
consume nicotine, third consumed drug cannabis one form
another. many probably shouting, "What caffeine?
caffeine?" Well, context drugs, particular, addictive drugs, caffeine
doesn't quite rise list, look caffeine include list,
caffeine those. commonly used drugs alcohol,
second nicotine cannabis. Nicotine, may know,
listen episode nicotine, even didn't, nicotine comes
tobacco plant, plants include nicotine, typically
brought brain body smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco
vaping nicotine. Nicotine exists outside world plants, tobacco
plants, reason effect body so-called nicotinic
receptors body. Now, nicotinic receptors named nicotine,
compound, existed brain body, not existence
tobacco plant, chemicals body naturally occur,
namely acetylcholine bind nicotine receptor. chemicals,
acetylcholine, bind nicotinic receptor brain body create enhanced
sense focus, et cetera, et cetera. But, nicotine tobacco binds receptor,
much greater affinity, therefore also creates state focus, much
greater one can achieve without nicotine. can see nicotine episode
want learn that. similar way, brains bodies,
time conceived, believe not, shortly conception,
want accurate, early conception, womb, still now,
listening this, called cannabinoid receptors,
also endogenous cannabinoids. mean that? receptors,
like little parking spots present cells brain body,
call ligand, basically just chemical released, parks
receptor causes number different biological effects. Cannabis contains
compounds also bind receptors, want make really clear
distinction. called endogenous ligands, just mean chemicals
within us make naturally, even never go near cannabis plant
source cannabis, chemicals created us park
receptors cause biological effects mood, perception, immune


system, hunger, et cetera, again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
endogenous cannabinoids. endogenous cannabinoids floating around
us, say, released us particular ways, bind receptors
cause changes mood, appetite, et cetera. many different effects
brain body, talk those. just like nicotine,
substances outside world, case, cannabis contains substances,
things like THC like CBD, ingested smoking vaping ingesting
edibles also will park receptors, cannabinoid receptors lead
biological effects. Now, little bit misleading, call cannabinoid
receptors bind cannabis, just like call nicotine
receptors, nicotinic receptors, makes seem order bind
nicotine tobacco, not way brains bodies evolved. brains
bodies evolved receptors make use chemicals exist within us,
called again, endogenous chemicals, endogenous chemicals lead certain
effects, mentioned before. key thing here, haven't understood anything
set now, please understand this, key thing THC CBD
components cannabis bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, ones naturally make, much greater affinity exert vastly
greater potency effect mood perception, et cetera, endogenous
cannabinoids. Another analogy one take order understand
hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana
plant, plants grow ground, naturally occurring,
receptors body without need engineer
external source, genome. program it, born
things, keep entire life. Many people mistakenly think, ah,
plant compounds safer us better us, somehow appropriate
us ingest, simply not true, here, not saying cannabis always
bad idea people. certain populations certain people can
relatively safe recreationally, truth, populations
can downright dangerous, recreationally medicinally. course,
medicinal purposes explored, talk that.
vital understand, think hear, "Oh, plant, natural,"
also receptor these, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
therefore, marriage two, coming together chemical THC CBD
receptors somehow supposed happen purpose
receptors, simply not case. way nicotinic
receptors not nicotine good us,
compounds

00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence

exist within us good bind receptors time time. Now,
key thing about, guess today, saying lot key things,
another key thing understanding cannabis way works,
THC CBD, brought brain body smoking
edible, et cetera, bind receptors, endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
tap systems endogenous cannabinoids tap into,
ones affect mood energy creativity relaxation, et cetera,
thousand fold greater potency. consequence that, endogenous


cannabinoids outcompeted. really get no opportunity interact
receptors. understanding that, can lead clear understanding why,
instance, people use cannabis relieve anxiety, use cannabis enter
certain brain state creativity enter sleep, dependence cannabis starts
emerge. don't ingest cannabis, again, ingest mean smoke
bring THC in, CBD in, ingest orally even transdermal tincture one
varieties, don't that, happens not receptors not
stimulated degree potency normally are,
endogenous cannabinoids can no longer effect, people experience
heightened levels anxiety, disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, on. Now,
again, want clear not trying paint picture cannabis bad
even partially bad. want today give much information can
cannabis works, different component parts work, different types
cannabis work, point valid medicinal uses
recreational uses, lay landscape really risk
terms psychoactive components, immune components forth,
can make informed choice you. not tell
not do. like say, wish, mean, don't wish
harms people yourself, wish, know doing,
really goal here. begin dive biology, think
start get clearer picture cannabis effective context, also
can create massive suffering contexts way

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now
effects CB1 receptor occupied THC occupied CBD, not
nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk
sorts problems. again, feel obligated say, not saying
don't ingest cannabis THC CBD. not saying. saying
evaluate potency technical terms, affinity

like howitzer gun, like cannon going off, compared endogenous

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going

particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual

discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,

confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group

group not. turns commonly observed divergence

THC particular, people not, fact, experience suppression

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual
arousal number different measures. won't go that. largely
subjective. studies actually measured things like


erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called
sexual arousal process. study, also took blood samples look
concentration things like cannabinoids, really nice study
actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals
reacted erotic stimuli different ways. measured hormones, namely
cortisol, stress hormone, tends negatively correlate sexual
arousal prolactin. interesting takeaway study people,
didn't matter males females, 'cause looked both, people

group, so-called Group A, experienced elevated levels sexual arousal
influence cannabis viewing erotic stimuli, group not show

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels
prolactin response cannabis, no, actually cannabis will suppress sexual
response desire. If, however, category person not
elevated levels prolactin response cannabis, well then, erotic stimuli can
potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one


category individual another. key thing understand levels
prolactin heading study not predict whether not people respond
cannabis elevated non elevated even reduced levels sexual arousal.
whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether
not levels arousal go not. somebody who, yes,
experience elevated levels sexual arousal function went influence
cannabis, well likely cannabis not increase prolactin levels,
least not significant degree taking it. somebody
not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin
levels. Very, clear. Now, might say, "Didn't, just describe study "about
set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level
sexual desire went up?" Yes, subset individuals true,
people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby
dopamine increased people sexually aroused, orgasm,

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada

hormones, like testosterone estrogen. Many people, say people, make
testosterone estrogen varying degrees. going depend whether not
male, female, age, whether not gone puberty, et cetera, et
cetera, just take testosterone example. testosterone circulating
body. true male female, receptors called androgen
receptors, even call testosterone receptors. testosterone binds
receptors effects cells. causes hair growth, changes voice. can
affect libido. affects sorts things brain body, depending organ
tissue talking about. course, people take synthetic
testosterone derivatives testosterone, derivatives, instance,
body building community sports community, will take things like
Dianabol. modified versions testosterone can bind testosterone
receptor much greater affinity, say androgen receptor much
greater affinity, supra physiological effects, effects essentially never


seen testosterone endogenously, excuse me, endogenously released
within body. say thing estrogen. estrogen
receptors, bind estrogen, someone take synthetic estrogen
ingest plant compound contains various estrogenic compounds, plants
certainly exist there, can supra physiological effects receptors.
telling this? Well, many people believe cannabis, marijuana

endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't

talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero

later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood

interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one

increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time

describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar

Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens

probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds

four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days

just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed
paranoid smoke sativa varieties varieties cannabis ingest

might predict occur little bit. just want give sense

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing

really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood

also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System
Function

out-competes natural endogenous cannabinoid systems. talk
endogenous cannabinoid systems, work,
will give us lens higher potency maximum impact
various cannabis plant varieties strains THC CBD forth,
work. endogenous cannabinoids, chemical substances
everybody makes? make them, make them. making basically
time conceived, going make time
die. Whether not impact biological functions


describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now

nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force
precision stubbornness refusal leave receptor completely
outcompete endogenous cannabinoid system. fact, leave endogenous
cannabinoid system essentially dysfunctional, which, cases, may good
thing, cases, going lead problems various kinds, talk

fairly complete understanding different varieties cannabis, least broad

00:53:07 Biological Effects Cannabis

least terms major receptors retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, take step back real world evaluate think happens
somebody smokes cannabis ingests cannabis way edible tincture
something sort. Cannabis fast enter bloodstream. fact, within 30
seconds, going enter brain permeate throughout brain body.
very, fast. mean, contrast something like alcohol even
nicotine, depending nicotine delivered, fast delivery
psychoactive biologically active compound, case THC CBD
probably things well. within 30 seconds, reaches brain
bodily tissues, within 30 60 minutes, going reach peak concentrations
peak biological effects. aren't always thing, case
cannabis, using cannabis umbrella term THC CBD,
effects going peak 30 60 minutes bringing compounds
body way another. effects tend last anywhere three
four hours, although variation that, depending individual metabolism,
whether not somebody familiar compound, believe not, psychologically
familiar, also biologically familiar, whether not first time use occasional
use on. THC CBD components cannabis highly call
lipophilic. is, affinity toward, can actually pass fatty
tissues. Now, every cell body, especially neurons, double layer fat
outside. course, people hear "fat," always think, ooh, fat's bad.
world seems want lose fat bodily fat. talking
fatty membrane, barrier around tissue, case talking particularly
neurons. THC CBD components cannabis highly
lipophilic, can get essentially cells just simply flowing them.
will also remain cells long time. So, know number people,
depending whether not get tested work sport otherwise
cannabis CBD THC, don't take strict number, typically, one ingests
CBD THC, smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera, doesn't matter, going


stay fatty tissue can detected least long 80 days
ingestion, whole industry accelerate clearance,
just tell just losing bodily fat isn't going eliminate system,
maybe partially fat cells, certainly intravisceral fat fatty tissue

00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia

parking endogenous cannabinoid receptors impacting signaling
neurons, leads subjective effects cannabis, including THC
CBDs, talk different subjective effects are. Again, going
vary depending whether not people ingesting sativa varieties cannabis,
just remind you, tend elevated mood, alertness, talkativeness. People
take sativa varieties tend talk lot otherwise. Again,
exceptions this, course exceptions. sure people
shouting, although guess quiet people don't talk much,
probably not shouting, not, not sativa, Joe contended,
event, exceptions, also general rules. sativas tend
make people's mood elevated, energetic, again, sort head high, indica
varieties tend opposite. sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
that? Well, without going extensive deep dive different
neurotransmitter systems brain body, know sure CB1
receptors present enormous number different neurons brain structures
neural circuits, sativa varieties act stimulant, making people feel
happy, 'cause general, tend elevate mood, least certain dosages,
talkative, tend make people feel like ideas interesting,
might want share, tend narrow context, tend increase focus.
something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties
can increase people's level focus particular things, something watching
something music, allows narrow sense focus.


going occur activation CB1 receptors so-called prefrontal cortex,
just behind forehead, prefrontal cortex acts strong modulator so-
called limbic circuitry circuitry stress oriented. way think
stress limbic circuitry, amygdala, many people
heard about, aren't really circuits fear stress. circuits
constantly evaluating one's internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
happening externally, and, sorry say, default systems detect
danger, threat detection systems. prefrontal cortex largely acts
brake systems, like reins pulling back steed horses
otherwise just take off. so, sativa varieties tend increase CB1 activation
prefrontal cortex circuitry leads overall reduction stress,
way prefrontal circuitry can reduce activation amygdala. Now
that, course, not explain people become stressed

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people

strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker

lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set

again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain

describe will depend lot whether not using
endogenous cannabinoids park receptors also birth
death, whether not tickling receptors strongly activating
receptors using external source like cannabis THC, et cetera. two main
endogenous cannabinoids want consider anandamide, will refer
EAE, anandamide, another one, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
arachidonoyl-glycerol, will abbreviate 2-AG. just take EAE 2-AG,
lump together talk endogenous cannabinoids, just make simple.
want deep dive anadamide versus 2-AG, please guest.
endogenous cannabinoids released neurons. neurons? Neurons
nerve cells. nerve cells conceptualized like this. presynaptic
neurons postsynaptic neurons. Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
little bubbles full neurotransmitter, chemicals, neurons
stimulated electrically, thought, desire
move, drug, hungry, relevant
neurons will vomit will fuse, say, little packets, little bubbles
neurotransmitter gap pre postsynaptic neuron, call
synaptic cleft synapse. little gap, little space, neurotransmitter
flows across synapse, will park little parking spots call
receptors postsynaptic neuron side. Depending neurotransmitter is,
bunch things not worth going right now, parking chemical
neurotransmitter receptors will either cause neuron postsynaptic
side itself, release neurotransmitter elsewhere, will quiet down, so-called
excitation inhibition. kind neuro transmission nutshell. don't
understand it, no big deal. not going prevent understanding today's
discussion. understand even small fraction just said, going
allow understand not just today's discussion, lot neuroscience lot
nuance depth understanding. key thing know endogenous
cannabinoids unlike neurotransmitters, released
postsynaptic side. happens neurotransmitter goes presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron, certain conditions, postsynaptic neuron, itself,
releases chemical, chemical goes backward, call retrogradely,
presynaptic neuron, binds receptors changes probability
presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter. Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids


tend decrease probability neuron will release neurotransmitter.
break system. way shutting communication
neurons, regulating it, not make completely quiet, adjust levels lot
nuance. Now, thing endogenous cannabinoids mind bender,
talking cannabis, commonly known feature cannabis
marijuana consumption disruptions short-term memory, essentially zero
debate whether not occurs, talk mechanisms little bit
later. yet, endogenous cannabinoids, chemicals naturally release
postsynaptic neurons travel retrogradely back presynaptic neuron,
actually can lead strengthening connections presynaptic neuron
postsynaptic neuron process called long-term potentiation, LTP.
can also cause called depression communication presynaptic
neuron postsynaptic neuron. Long-term depression nothing
depression psychological state illness. Long-term potentiation long-term
depression simply refer probability one neuron will able stimulate
activate another neuron. And, just told you, endogenous cannabinoids can either
turn dial turn dial. can either increase probability
decrease probability given connection neurons will function
will function less. think communication neurons
crosstalk, conversation, well, endogenous cannabinoids can dictate whether
not conversation likely occur not occur. Think either putting
someone top text chain phone, long-term
potentiation, essentially blocking number, essentially long-term
depression. So, getting impression endogenous cannabinoids
working number different ways, not straightforward, right.
fact, message like take away. endogenous cannabinoids
sometimes increasing neuronal communication. can lead increases mood
increases likelihood someone will talk certain way behave certain
way feel certain way. can also lead decreases synaptic transmission,
communication neurons, ways will make somebody's mood lower,
will make less hungry hungry. And, really key thing,
two kinds endogenous cannabinoid receptors, referred CB1 CB2,
can say confidence CB1 highly enriched nervous system,
especially within brain. found not everywhere, almost everywhere brain


elsewhere nervous system, spinal cord aspects nervous
system. CB2, cannabinoid receptor, CB2 largely located tissues body,
including immune system, liver, even genitals, et cetera. means
endogenous cannabinoids sorts effects neurons
talked about, also effects immune cells, reproductive organs,
liver, digestion, hunger, et cetera, mechanisms divorced
function nervous system neurons. Now, reality, no system brain
body divorced nervous system, nervous system
controlling everything. really master controller, everything's feeding back
nervous system, two way street. simple way think CB1
receptors mainly nervous system, CB2 receptors mainly body
endogenous cannabinoids, again, EAE, anandamide, 2-AG, arachidonoyl-
glycerol, impacting CB1 CB2 receptors. Today mainly going talk
CB1 receptors, 'cause ones responsible familiar
effects cannabis, key takeaway point really understand
major effects endogenous cannabinoids receptors particular CB1
nuanced. depends context, depends neurons. sometimes
increasing communication neurons, sometimes decreasing it, along
comes cannabis, cannabis, again, can arrive smoking, vaping, edible.
cannabis contains THC CBD potently bind CB1 receptor, now

nuanced. fact, predictable especially important understand
strong, park receptor affinity, force

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation

talking about, well then, yes, will position

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual

second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little
confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual

subjective. studies actually measured things like


erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called
sexual arousal process. study, also took blood samples look
concentration things like cannabinoids, really nice study
actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals

cortisol, stress hormone, tends negatively correlate sexual

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

elevated levels prolactin response cannabis, well then, erotic stimuli can
potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one


category individual another. key thing understand levels

cannabis elevated non elevated even reduced levels sexual arousal.
whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether

topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin

set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby
dopamine increased people sexually aroused, orgasm,

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada

directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings

interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,

true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

something not often discussed cannabis, especially sativa varieties

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether

not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens

areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing

achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within

just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one

whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether

not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain

changes one's speech specific way. study Adam
Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered
Speech Production," will provide link that, first author, Adam Vogel, really
like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults
History Recreational "Cannabis Use Altered Speech Production," tells
pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,
recreational use medicinal use, undergo pretty profound changes way
speak, specific set ways. Now, first all, changes speech
shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain
toward inaction. cannabis impacts CB1 receptors cerebellum,
involved motor planning, execution balance. So, regardless whether not

changes one's speech specific way. study Adam
Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

might read sentence. "Cannabis, marijuana, commonly used
"illicit drug world approximately 4% adults "age 15 64 years reporting

taken liberty pick extreme example sort occasionally
observe evaluating subjects paper. said something like,
[mumbling low tone] "Cannabis, marijuana, "is commonly used illicit drug,"

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

definition terms title will make easier understand
paper, just march results,
straightforward easy understand interesting. fMRI just functional
magnetic resonance imaging, basically subjects experiment came
laboratory. either people not used cannabis used
cannabis before. placed brain scanner, one fMRI devices.
looks like tube people backed can view images there,
brain can imaged without remove skull drill skull,
no neurosurgery. participants study grouped according whether
not experienced aphrodisiac effects intoxication cannabis,
first group, Group A, literally called group aphrodisiac.
second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little
confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group
experiences sexual arousal influence cannabis, THC specifically.
group not. turns commonly observed divergence
effects cannabis. people experience lot sexual arousal cannabis
THC particular, people not, fact, experience suppression

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual
arousal number different measures. won't go that. largely
subjective. studies actually measured things like


erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called
sexual arousal process. study, also took blood samples look
concentration things like cannabinoids, really nice study
actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals
reacted erotic stimuli different ways. measured hormones, namely
cortisol, stress hormone, tends negatively correlate sexual
arousal prolactin. interesting takeaway study people,
didn't matter males females, 'cause looked both, people
experienced elevated prolactin levels cannabis intoxication, refer
it. People take cannabis, measured prolactin. people elevated

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels
prolactin response cannabis, no, actually cannabis will suppress sexual
response desire. If, however, category person not
elevated levels prolactin response cannabis, well then, erotic stimuli can
potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one


category individual another. key thing understand levels
prolactin heading study not predict whether not people respond
cannabis elevated non elevated even reduced levels sexual arousal.
whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether
not levels arousal go not. somebody who, yes,
experience elevated levels sexual arousal function went influence
cannabis, well likely cannabis not increase prolactin levels,
least not significant degree taking it. somebody
not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin
levels. Very, clear. Now, might say, "Didn't, just describe study "about
set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level
sexual desire went up?" Yes, subset individuals true,
people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby
dopamine increased people sexually aroused, orgasm,

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look

somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?

actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally

order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people

strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker

lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis

present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal

important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,

true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis

THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled

increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed

strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker

lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing

whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.

takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks

cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine

within university laboratories laboratories can keep up. point, think
appropriate ask ourselves, people even use cannabis?
trying achieve? always not feeling pain? always reducing
anxiety? Well, sometimes is, oftentimes people using cannabis order
achieve particular state. use broad brush say, "Well, just like
high," may true lot circumstances, believe
actually true lot circumstances, lot people use cannabis
directed way, get, quote unquote, high, order achieve states
particularly attractive, one state state creativity. brings
us broader theme, is, cannabis increase creativity? so,
THC, CBD, appropriate ratio best ratio accessing creativity?
interesting important discussion, believe, creativity one
sought elusive states humans can experience. yet,
look human evolution, look progression terms technology development
culture music poetry, et cetera, really can look creativity state
fostered much evolution. whether not technology,
art music, whether not just somebody wants expand
understanding experience life way, creativity fundamentally
important state try access try access regularly try tap into,
order eventually produce something, order create something meaning
exists not just creative state, creative state gone
away, painting paint creative state hopefully painting still
inspires impact exit creative state will inspire others,
true number different things, not just painting. cannabis


increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change

really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,
recreational use medicinal use, undergo pretty profound changes way

shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,

can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different
individuals can highly divergent, meaning one set individuals, cannabis will make
far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also

like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal

today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look

somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly

increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning

say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing

really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered

shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood

also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much

think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

increase creativity? short answer is, depends. First all, need define
creativity. are, thinking scientists, not already scientists,
basically two modes thinking associated creativity, don't
completely explain creativity. look research, psychology research
neuroscience research, hear convergent thinking divergent
thinking. Convergent thinking taking loose ideas kind braiding together,
finding common thread, synthesizing, organizing different ideas
common specific framework order get create specific outcome.
convergent thinking basically person room listening ideas
taking in. Maybe panel of, get certain product
market? different motifs include piece music?
terms rearchitecting given physical space? Taking
different opinions, different ideas different people, synthesizing
coming one small subset coherent ideas incorporate
ones heard, convergent thinking. doesn't involve
panel people talking you. use example goes inside
head engaging convergent thinking. thinking, well,
said this, think that, braiding trying get
common themes, common vector emerge that. Divergent thinking,
hand, best described brainstorming. exploring ideas continuing
move variation vastness ideas hopes eventually able
converge novel idea framework. similar related,
typically creativity process involves first brainstorming divergent thinking,
order arrive something, actually create something, verb 'create,' not
just thinking might create, occurs divergent thinking,
actually creating something, specific painting, specific song, specific body
literature, specific scientific project experiment on, usually involves
convergent thinking. Now can explored laboratory, can
explored laboratories sets different types questionnaires even
tasks can give human subjects, done extensively across
entire body data, mean, literally hundreds studies
explored relationship particular neuro circuits neurochemicals,
convergent divergent thinking. can arrive principle, principle
involves molecule many heard before, dopamine.


Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered
Speech Production," will provide link that, first author, Adam Vogel, really
like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults
History Recreational "Cannabis Use Altered Speech Production," tells
pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,
recreational use medicinal use, undergo pretty profound changes way
speak, specific set ways. Now, first all, changes speech
shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain
toward inaction. cannabis impacts CB1 receptors cerebellum,
involved motor planning, execution balance. So, regardless whether not
people using cannabis sativa indica variety, disruptions
motor circuitry. And, may heard, listened episode
Rockefeller professor, Dr. Erich Jarvis, works speech movement, speech
movement. movements mouth, movements hands,
intimately related terms speech. fact, centers brain involved
hand movements part speech areas vice versa. Erich actually pointed
put hands behind back, provided normally use
hands, actually will reduce fluidity speech, going put back
front now. point is, smoking marijuana consuming marijuana edible
changes one's speech specific way. study Adam
Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

Dopamine neuromodulator. involved motivation, tends direct
attention things outside us, also closely related convergent thinking
divergent thinking creative process. therefore, come no
surprise diseases nervous system, excuse me, bipolar disorder,
done episode bipolar disorder schizophrenia mood
disorders impact levels dopamine, either make way, way high way,
way low, strongly impact whether not people will creative. think short
takeaway makes sense terms framing this, covered
episode bipolar disorder, sometimes called bipolar depression,
professions lot creativity required order succeed, again,
musicians, composers, artists, et cetera, tend find manic depression,
manic depression, least manic states, hyperactive states, correlated
elevated levels dopamine. Likewise, seen throughout
history individuals mild forms schizophrenia, even full-blown
schizophrenia, many famous painters instance, musicians, known
elevated levels dopamine, quite creative. Now, doesn't mean
everybody creative elevated levels dopamine, although likely
levels dopamine least not diminished, doesn't mean non-creative
people low levels dopamine, don't get carried away interpretation
here. point this, dopamine levels strongly relate probability can
engage convergent divergent thinking, following way.
dopamine levels high, divergent thinking likely. is, people
lot dopamine circulating system, tend expansive
ideas, tend brainstorm lot, tend comfortable even want to,
reflexively throw lot ideas sometimes even seem little disconnected.
people might think attention deficit, not. really idea
throwing disparate ideas. hear sometimes, throw things wall
see sticks, obviously analogy, people throwing lots things
wall seeing stick, seeing things stick fit
together, divergent thinking, elevations dopamine tend increase divergent
thinking. However, tend inverted U-shape way.
either watching YouTube, just drawing hump, obviously,
listening, just imagine U, shape letter U, just flip upside down,
looks like bump. Turns dopamine levels low, low


probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered
Speech Production," will provide link that, first author, Adam Vogel, really
like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,

can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

inhaling smoke lungs, yes, also vaping, bringing chemicals transport
nicotine, case, cannabis, lungs way vaping severely
detrimental endothelial cells. think years ago, vaping wasn't
prominent, question idea maybe vaping going far
healthier least not bad smoking, now can see huge number
negative health effects vaping, distinct effects smoking.
like information smoking versus vaping, please see episode

really no way slice dice candy coat it. fact matter
smoking clear severe negative health consequences, regardless whether
not smoking tobacco cannabis, THC, vaping negative health

course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis

also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say

certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain

various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look

statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people
starting use cannabis age bracket 16 24. Many
functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use
age bracket 16 24, twice likely use individuals start using
cannabis individuals. Plus, general perception there,
way cannabis discussed media sports figures celebrities

probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels high, mentioned before,
high level probability divergent thinking. dopamine levels go
very, high, again, reduction divergent thinking. words,
sweet spot elevated dopamine divergent thinking. again, divergent
thinking critical creativity process, creativity definition taking
novel set ideas arranging particular way, taking existing ideas
arranging novel way eventually converge new product,
new idea, new song, et cetera. Now, convergent thinking follows different pattern.
dopamine levels high, convergent thinking not likely.
dopamine levels low, convergent thinking likely. here, using arguably
reductionist view, looking thing calling creativity
neurosciencey reductionist lens, can say this. creative process involves
going state willing consider lot options, many seem
distantly not even connected one another, dopamine facilitates divergent
thinking state perfectly happy fact, experience joy, elation,
comfort pleasure organizing different ideas anyone else might
seem not related. dopamine levels elevated, seem like
great ideas maybe connections there. not accepting
true valid interesting combining them, idea worth
entertaining possibility, least moments. then, dopamine levels drop,
process convergent thinking, taking options off wall
saying, "No, no, doesn't fit that, "that doesn't fit that, "but ah, fits
that, can work. "That feels right sounds right looks right."
creativity process. so, think not just important understanding cannabis,
get back moment, important understanding creativity
brain states general. Brain states not, say, square wave function.
don't just drop trench creativity. Creativity not event, process.
telling process involves divergent thinking
consideration lot different ideas. correlated high not high
dopamine. then, one transition state convergent thinking,
really honing ideas seem validity validity
getting rid everything else, associated low dopamine.

01:26:41 Cannabis Increase Creativity?



logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered
Speech Production," will provide link that, first author, Adam Vogel, really
like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults
History Recreational "Cannabis Use Altered Speech Production," tells
pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,
recreational use medicinal use, undergo pretty profound changes way
speak, specific set ways. Now, first all, changes speech
shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain
toward inaction. cannabis impacts CB1 receptors cerebellum,
involved motor planning, execution balance. So, regardless whether not
people using cannabis sativa indica variety, disruptions
motor circuitry. And, may heard, listened episode
Rockefeller professor, Dr. Erich Jarvis, works speech movement, speech
movement. movements mouth, movements hands,
intimately related terms speech. fact, centers brain involved
hand movements part speech areas vice versa. Erich actually pointed
put hands behind back, provided normally use
hands, actually will reduce fluidity speech, going put back
front now. point is, smoking marijuana consuming marijuana edible
changes one's speech specific way. study Adam
Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,
commonly used, "illicit drug world approximately 4% adults, "aged 15 64

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

logical implementation consideration opposed thinking
considering everything. now return question whether not
cannabis different components increase creativity. look
literature this, find studies clearly point yes, increases creativity,
not surprising, therefore, cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
dopamine levels, certain brain areas, particular brain areas involved thinking
planning. cannabis increases dopamine areas. Elevated dopamine
increases divergent thinking, divergent thinking associated creativity,
studies support idea cannabis can increase creativity. However,
least many studies say cannabis not increase creativity,
cannabis increases consideration multiple ideas, perhaps elevation
dopamine related systems, ultimately ideas converge
not truly creative ideas, least don't meet criteria creative brainstorming
extraction ideas truly novel, doesn't increase creativity, one
it? Well, fortunately, entirely distinct set literature taken
literature consideration, arrive. really nice
study explored creativity cannabis users, will provide link study.
First author Emily LaFrance, title paper, somewhat amusing
right, is, starts question, inspired Mary Jane, course, Mary Jane
one old school versions ways talking cannabis marijuana.
Nowadays, people refer mainly pot, names too, course, title
paper is, "Inspired Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying "Enhanced Creativity
Cannabis Users." really like study couple reasons. First all,
looked people not use cannabis well people used cannabis,
two different groups, not evaluate creativity cannabis users
influence cannabis. looked level creativity
cannabis users not influence cannabis asked
whether not ability creative enhanced cannabis. Now going
compare studies people come laboratory actually use
cannabis, evaluate creativity context. study
unique takeaways think really interesting. First all, did, yes, see
evidence enhanced creativity, say enhanced creativity, mean within
context divergent thinking thing talked moment ago. say


enhanced, mean significantly greater non-users, people don't use
cannabis. right now can imagine cannabis users cheering, "Yes,
cannabis increases creativity, "makes people creative
otherwise." Well, interesting. ask
accomplished. turns one major ways accomplished
cannabis users, even not influence cannabis, far
open novel ideas, explorative reduced anxiety,
say lower anxiety mode thinking explore novel ideas, essential
divergent thinking. observed enhanced divergent convergent creative
type thinking cannabis users. source that, conclude is, here,
just quote, "Cannabis users' higher levels "of openness experience responsible
"for enhanced self-reported creativity "and convergent thinking test performance."
not necessarily cannabis increasing capacity brain areas
associated creativity, rather, cannabis appears increasing openness
probably part lowering anxiety particular people,
openness leading inclusion ideas divergent thinking process.
willing consider throwing things wall see stick,
speak. conclusions, really nice statement. Again, just read
paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream
media propagated idea "that cannabis expands mind enhances
creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that
related cannabis use. "For example, openness experience related "to
cannabis use augmented creativity." real chicken/egg argument.
mean that? mean is, paper finds people open
experience likely use cannabis, people use cannabis going
open new experiences, combination features, openness
experience, openness new experiences brings, enhances
convergent divergent thinking characteristic creative process.
short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap
creative process, rather directly impacting neural circuits that, instance, turn
creativity. say, study really important, exploring
cannabis users, not influence cannabis, able tap


important, believe fact. think study
one group using cannabis another group not using cannabis,
give task taps creativity, will see effects likely,
see effects cannabis might even increase divergent convergent thinking
creativity. results actually published many times before. given
varied effects cannabis THC talked earlier,
complex signaling stuff, can imagine will also studies, fact,
are, divergent convergent thinking creativity not assisted
cannabis might even reduced ingesting cannabis. However, one considers
divergent thinking absolutely crucial creativity process range
things one will explore will enhanced openness reduced levels
anxiety, willingness explore different options, might seem
completely crazy, cannabis increases personality types reduces anxiety
create sense openness, well makes perfect sense cannabis
increase creativity certain individuals, not directly. study, one
just referred to, say published journal, "Consciousness
Cognition," again, provide link it, wonderful job teasing
impact cannabis personality, impacts creativity. somebody asks
you, wondering, feel like cannabis increases creativity,
sense answer 'yes,' answer 'yes' ways shapes
openness new ideas can, say 'can,' not everybody, can,
individuals, reduce anxiety. means somebody
experiences anxiety increased levels focus cannabis, regardless strain,
imagine people exploring different strains, exploring
all, exploring different modes delivery, smoking ingestible, et cetera.
somebody experiences anxiety, likely won't
increased openness experience divergent ideas will facilitate creativity.
However, somebody achieves heightened levels relaxation
reduced levels anxiety cannabis, regardless strain happen
talking about, well then, yes, will position

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

heightened state creativity, least defined convergent divergent


thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use
twice week more. Think occasional use less realize within
realm chronic use, excuse me, 'or more' can anywhere twice week,
every day, just evenings, et cetera. effects chronic use cannabis,
just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing
certain syllables, slowing speech, many cases total change
alteration way people speak use language, influence
cannabis not influence cannabis chronic users.
really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion
discussion, realizing that, course, not exactly thing.
excellent study entitled, "Adults History Recreational Cannabis Use "Have Altered
Speech Production," will provide link that, first author, Adam Vogel, really
like paper. published journal, "Drug Alcohol Dependence." will


provide link like peruse detail. title itself, "Adults

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis
oftentimes will become talkative, much talkative. However, whether not
people tend rely sativa cannabis use indica cannabis use,
consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

speak, specific set ways. Now, first all, changes speech
shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,
remember go, no-go circuitry, circuitry makes want things,
circuitry makes want withhold action? tends shift body brain

can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,
commonly used, "illicit drug world approximately 4% adults, "aged 15 64

might read sentence. "Cannabis, marijuana, commonly used
"illicit drug world approximately 4% adults "age 15 64 years reporting

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,

paper, said better ever could, quote, "While mainstream

creativity, "our results show link cannabis creativity "is largely
spurious correlation," meaning not case cannabis increases creativity,
but, inserted 'but' quote, "driven differences personality "that

short, cannabis increases creativity, changes personality tap

01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes Speech Patterns

thinking. One characteristic, say stereotype qualities people
smoke lot marijuana ingest cannabis means changed
patterns speech. fact, lore clinical realm can predict get
strong indication whether not somebody cannabis user pot smoker
based voice particular tone voice lack inflection.
lot speculation here, fortunately, studied. like discuss now
whether not cannabis can impact patterns speech, acutely, meaning
influence cannabis, time, chronic cannabis users.
say 'chronic cannabis use,' want specific mean. Chronic cannabis use
not necessarily mean people smoking cannabis ingesting cannabis
every day, although certainly are, qualifies chronic use. Chronic use
regular use time anywhere twice week more. using cannabis
month not considered chronic use, even many, many years. Using
cannabis ingesting cannabis way form twice week considered
chronic use. course, going ask split hairs
say, "Well, somebody uses twice month?" Well, listen, clinical literature,
scientific literature don't get specific. course, infinite
number ways arrange one's cannabis use, everything zero, none all,
constantly, every day, day everywhere between. think chronic use

just defined it, speech studied. characteristic, drawing

really want distinguish THC CBD just make really simple
say CBD not responsible psychoactive effects cannabis,
whereas THC is, again, ratio CBD THC going relevant there,
just think cannabis THC one portion

pretty much everything need know, except important nuance
here, because, mentioned earlier, people smoke sativa varieties cannabis

consistent finding people chronic users, twice week more,

shouldn't surprise us all, sativa varieties cannabis indica varieties
cannabis impact brain centers involved movement, basal ganglia,

Vogel colleagues, explored huge different variety aspects speech.
can done using spectral processing, fancy nerd speak looking
much inflection looking long people hold vowels consonants, et
cetera, again, people not influence cannabis, rather
people tend influence cannabis not participating
study, words, chronic recreational cannabis users. two major
shifts cannabis causes patterns speech? Well, first one change
called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort


intensity "are important components speech," way say sentence
striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt
vocal effort intensity, "and differed groups appeared change "in
line duration abstinence cannabis use." think not far cry
change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different
individuals can highly divergent, meaning one set individuals, cannabis will make
far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also
sexual activity. beautifully illustrated context sexual desire
journal, "Psycho-pharmacology," paper published 2017. title paper is,

first group, Group A, literally called group aphrodisiac.
second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little
confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual

erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit

certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts

evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

called spectral tilt. Again, fancy nerd speak vocal effort intensity. So,
not pot smoker, confess, say sentence, "Vocal effort

striving enunciate carefully accent certain words syllables.
pot smoker somebody uses recreational cannabis fairly often
reduced spectral tilt, AKA, vocal effort intensity, might say, [mumbling] "Spectral tilt

change spectral tilt observed here. addition, changes
verbal timing, pronunciation words accenting particular syllables words
people consume cannabis smoke cannabis. rather emphasize
particular words within sentence, again, just use sentence paper
can gain knowledge paper, "Cannabis," say way
say it, since not cannabis user. "Cannabis, marijuana,

Movement also controls speech, therefore, cannabis impacting speech. Now


like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different
individuals can highly divergent, meaning one set individuals, cannabis will make
far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also
sexual activity. beautifully illustrated context sexual desire
journal, "Psycho-pharmacology," paper published 2017. title paper is,

first group, Group A, literally called group aphrodisiac.
second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little
confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group

THC particular, people not, fact, experience suppression

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual

erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called
sexual arousal process. study, also took blood samples look
concentration things like cannabinoids, really nice study
actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,

considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved

question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different

far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual

erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called

actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada

clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one

rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood

also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different
individuals can highly divergent, meaning one set individuals, cannabis will make
far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also

second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little

Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say

like turn attention whether not cannabis can increase sexual activity, sexual
desire, and/or sexual function, going talking libido, sexual
desire effects cannabis hormones. might sound like
discussion purely oriented towards recreational use cannabis, people
using cannabis heightened increase sense arousal sexual activity,
actually ventures clinical realm too, meaning excellent peer-
reviewed studies describe moment exploring use cannabis
THC, specifically, something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
refers persistent recurrent deficiency absence sexual fantasies thoughts
and/or desire for, receptivity to, sexual activity. disorder fairly
common, anywhere 6% 9% people, males females. used
considered higher prevalence females males, now numbers seem
evening out. basically, anywhere 6% 9% people
diminished sexual desire. so, number people interested
figuring ways increase amount sexual desire, course,
people general population may not hyperactive sexual desire disorder
interested using cannabis recreationally order increase desire for,
experience of, sexual activity. Now first acknowledge sexual
desire activity complex set processes, meaning not just one event, sex,
verb. involves arousal, involves sex, verb, involves whole set
mindsets emotional states vary tremendously individuals.
again, can distill basic principles, emphasize, no
means chemicals neuro circuits involved sexual arc, call it,
desire, act sex, et cetera, central it, vital it.
considered call necessary not sufficient, there'll
chemicals involved too, main chemicals neuro circuits involved
dopamine, so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, particular, brain structure
called nucleus accumbens, talk moment, vital
motivated behaviors seeking particular types pleasurable
experiences, sex no exception. hear nucleus accumbens
activated, almost always means dopamine released area
areas brain body, can consider dopamine central desire for,
pursuit of, act sex. addition that, molecules like oxytocin,
involved pair bonding, going neural circuit specific oxytocin


circuitry, terms sexual arousal sexual behavior, really dopamine
pathway nucleus accumbens, especially vital. allows us address
question, cannabis increase, decrease, no effect sexual desire
and/or ability sex? therein, will find interesting answers,
because, again, will point fact effects cannabis different
individuals can highly divergent, meaning one set individuals, cannabis will make
far less anxious. another set individuals, strain cannabis,
dosage, will make extremely anxious. can said also
sexual activity. beautifully illustrated context sexual desire
journal, "Psycho-pharmacology," paper published 2017. title paper is,
"Individual Prolactin Reactivity "Modulates Response Nucleus Accumbens Erotic
Stimuli "During Acute Cannabis Intoxication, fMRI Pilot Study." give little bit
definition terms title will make easier understand
paper, just march results,
straightforward easy understand interesting. fMRI just functional

cannabis before. placed brain scanner, one fMRI devices.
looks like tube people backed can view images there,
brain can imaged without remove skull drill skull,
no neurosurgery. participants study grouped according whether
not experienced aphrodisiac effects intoxication cannabis,
first group, Group A, literally called group aphrodisiac.
second group, thing don't like study,
rather call group B, called 'group non A,' just gets little
confusing. try simplify this. two groups, one group

group not. turns commonly observed divergence

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual
arousal number different measures. won't go that. largely
subjective. studies actually measured things like


erections males vaginal lubrication females, so-called autonomic responses
people can't lie about, speak, tap aspects so-called
sexual arousal process. study, also took blood samples look
concentration things like cannabinoids, really nice study
actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals
reacted erotic stimuli different ways. measured hormones, namely
cortisol, stress hormone, tends negatively correlate sexual
arousal prolactin. interesting takeaway study people,
didn't matter males females, 'cause looked both, people
experienced elevated prolactin levels cannabis intoxication, refer

group, so-called Group A, experienced elevated levels sexual arousal
influence cannabis viewing erotic stimuli, group not show
elevated levels prolactin response cannabis. this, believe, resolves
longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels
prolactin response cannabis, no, actually cannabis will suppress sexual
response desire. If, however, category person not
elevated levels prolactin response cannabis, well then, erotic stimuli can
potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one


category individual another. key thing understand levels
prolactin heading study not predict whether not people respond
cannabis elevated non elevated even reduced levels sexual arousal.
whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether
not levels arousal go not. somebody who, yes,
experience elevated levels sexual arousal function went influence
cannabis, well likely cannabis not increase prolactin levels,
least not significant degree taking it. somebody
not experience increases sexual arousal function even diminished sexual arousal

even reduced sexual arousal really litmus test one can figure out.
topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin
levels. Very, clear. Now, might say, "Didn't, just describe study "about
set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level
sexual desire went up?" Yes, subset individuals true,
people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby
dopamine increased people sexually aroused, orgasm,

Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain

selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering

low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

study, showed people groups erotic images, measured sexual

actually measured much THC bloodstream different individuals

cortisol, stress hormone, tends negatively correlate sexual

longstanding controversy field, is, cannabis increase sexual arousal?
Well, depends. fall category person elevated levels

elevated levels prolactin response cannabis, well then, erotic stimuli can
potentially fact, increase sexual arousal majority individuals. Now,
many probably hearing wondering whether not fall one


category individual another. key thing understand levels
prolactin heading study not predict whether not people respond
cannabis elevated non elevated even reduced levels sexual arousal.
whether not people's prolactin levels went not go up, predicted whether
not levels arousal go not. somebody who, yes,
experience elevated levels sexual arousal function went influence
cannabis, well likely cannabis not increase prolactin levels,

even reduced sexual arousal really litmus test one can figure out.
topic effects cannabis sexual function hormones
like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following
way. referring studies adults. talk developing
brain body little bit, clear smoking cannabis increases prolactin
levels. Very, clear. Now, might say, "Didn't, just describe study "about
set individuals whose prolactin didn't increase "and consequence, "their level
sexual desire went up?" Yes, subset individuals true,
people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby
dopamine increased people sexually aroused, orgasm,

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada

especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among

enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still

clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis

papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering

psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use

like prolactin, probably worth mentioning cannabis studied extensively
impact hormones, can summarize literature following

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One
way think context normal sexual arousal arc whereby

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada

twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review

people smoke cannabis experience increases prolactin, especially
pronounced people smoke cannabis twice week. important,
prolactin, referred earlier, reciprocal mutually inhibitory dopamine. One

now discussing biological psychological effects cannabis. Now
like shift attention negative health effects cannabis shine
light individuals groups need especially wary
probably avoid cannabis use entirely, including ingestion cannabis way

number people appreciate smoking tobacco smoking cannabis,
vaping tobacco, yes, vaping tobacco, vaping cannabis, negative
health consequences lungs so-called endothelial cells body,
cells make vasculature, capillaries blood vessels. don't already
know this, make clear, make brief. Whether not smoke
vape tobacco cannabis, severely impairing function endothelial cells
make capillaries blood vessels brain body, known
decrease cognitive capacity time, increase probability strokes, severely impact
lung function, also lead things like peripheral neuropathies. leads sexual

reproductive damage, including ovaries testes. Essentially, no
way state it, except smoking vaping negative health consequences
independent substances people trying get bloodstream
smoking vaping. people smoke vape tobacco, people smoke vape
cannabis, cases, just set aside direct effects tobacco
direct effects cannabis, can confidently say process smoking,
inhaling smoke lungs, yes, also vaping, bringing chemicals transport
nicotine, case, cannabis, lungs way vaping severely
detrimental endothelial cells. think years ago, vaping wasn't
prominent, question idea maybe vaping going far
healthier least not bad smoking, now can see huge number
negative health effects vaping, distinct effects smoking.
like information smoking versus vaping, please see episode

really no way slice dice candy coat it. fact matter
smoking clear severe negative health consequences, regardless whether

reason going related fact mentioned beginning
episode, CB1 CB2 receptors, two receptors cannabis

present soon conception, CB1 CB2 receptors actually play
critical role development fetus. Now, might wonder is,
course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis
exposed cannabis THC CBD. But, recall, endogenous cannabinoids
present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really
interesting. means endogenous cannabinoids activation CB1
CB2 receptors integral part neural development, going
become especially relevant considering whether not pregnant mothers
not use cannabis CBD, also points interesting biology

make absolutely terrifying, least me, frankly, terrifying
well. statement is, current statistics cannabis use pregnant

United States show 15%, one-five, 15% pregnant mothers report using cannabis

aware negative effects smoking developing fetus, ingestion

every critical aspect brain wiring development. Now, long-term implications
even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use
cannabis point pregnancy not yet known. is, say,
experiment ongoing. remiss didn't point data just
implore you, please, please, please, pregnant considering getting pregnant,
cannabis user, whether not using edibles, CBD user, please
whatever necessary not ingest cannabis smoke cannabis ingest CBD
pregnancy. Now, may certain clinical indications physician
OB/GYN, pediatrician will eventually pediatrician


child will prescribe CBD, although hard imagine are. contacted
number different pediatricians OB/GYNs not single one said

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-
coupled receptor, like bucket brigade kick off process
one molecule handed off another molecule handed off
another molecule. long chain cascade events. long chains
cascades events lot opportunity regulation, adjustment. Receptor
systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system
used tickled, not punched, tickled endogenous cannabinoids, every
binds, effect, certainly not bound incredible
potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery
smoking vaping vaping edible edible transdermal. Anyway,
go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among
individuals 16 24 years old. fact, individuals 16 24 years old,
particular, students people working, surprising, unemployed
populations, young, 16 24, least young, student
working doubles likelihood somebody going use cannabis regular
basis, twice per week. typical age initiating cannabis use nowadays
19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within
cells data point creating much, much higher likelihood
developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis
use, signaling mechanisms involved predisposing
individuals psychosis later life. look individuals start using cannabis,
even younger, age 14, even young 12, probability psychosis later life,
particular schizophrenic schizophrenic-like episodes doubles,

talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

say want study chronic cannabis use. Well, can't keep
laboratory time, rely self-report often use
cannabis form, can't really control one individual next
much cannabis THC bringing system. One person might

course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis

present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really

even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,

safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed

positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence

receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability

systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC

go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed

cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among

19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within

developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis

rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood

also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering

low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,

statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use

now discussing biological psychological effects cannabis. Now
like shift attention negative health effects cannabis shine
light individuals groups need especially wary
probably avoid cannabis use entirely, including ingestion cannabis way
edible. frame things way, think increasingly large
number people appreciate smoking tobacco smoking cannabis,
vaping tobacco, yes, vaping tobacco, vaping cannabis, negative
health consequences lungs so-called endothelial cells body,
cells make vasculature, capillaries blood vessels. don't already
know this, make clear, make brief. Whether not smoke
vape tobacco cannabis, severely impairing function endothelial cells
make capillaries blood vessels brain body, known
decrease cognitive capacity time, increase probability strokes, severely impact
lung function, also lead things like peripheral neuropathies. leads sexual
dysfunction, lack blood flow genitals, can lead aspects
reproductive damage, including ovaries testes. Essentially, no
way state it, except smoking vaping negative health consequences
independent substances people trying get bloodstream
smoking vaping. people smoke vape tobacco, people smoke vape
cannabis, cases, just set aside direct effects tobacco
direct effects cannabis, can confidently say process smoking,
inhaling smoke lungs, yes, also vaping, bringing chemicals transport
nicotine, case, cannabis, lungs way vaping severely
detrimental endothelial cells. think years ago, vaping wasn't
prominent, question idea maybe vaping going far
healthier least not bad smoking, now can see huge number
negative health effects vaping, distinct effects smoking.
like information smoking versus vaping, please see episode
nicotine. will also entire episode vaping future,
really no way slice dice candy coat it. fact matter
smoking clear severe negative health consequences, regardless whether
not smoking tobacco cannabis, THC, vaping negative health
consequences, whether not using vape bring nicotine



02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural

THC combination THC CBD. simply way is.
said, now like focus attention direct effects cannabis has, either
way THC action way CBD action terms positive negative health effects
brain body, going explore first function age.
reason going related fact mentioned beginning
episode, CB1 CB2 receptors, two receptors cannabis
THC CBD CBN psychoactive compounds cannabis bind
actions present throughout development. Believe not,
present soon conception, CB1 CB2 receptors actually play
critical role development fetus. Now, might wonder is,
course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis
exposed cannabis THC CBD. But, recall, endogenous cannabinoids
present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really
interesting. means endogenous cannabinoids activation CB1
CB2 receptors integral part neural development, going
become especially relevant considering whether not pregnant mothers
not use cannabis CBD, also points interesting biology

brain nervous system body fascinating vast literature, certainly far
vast cover today's episode, especially late hour were, will
future episode brain development. terms effects cannabis,
sufficient say cannabinoid receptors present active developing

adolescence. across time, conception adolescence, endogenous
cannabinoids mainly responsible actions cannabinoid receptors.
time, cannabinoid receptors specific effects
distinct effects later life, effects can largely explained terms
neural development. Again, don't time entire lecture now,


development, body collection bunch cells. actually called
blastula, means ball cells, cells actually grow
connections duplicate themselves, interesting process
neurons initially situated far apart, grow connections make
contacts one another. remove certain connections, depending kind
life events exposed to. wonderful event early life traumatic
early life, connections change, et cetera. important point today's
discussion CB1 receptor, particular, expressed every neuron

statement endogenous cannabinoids CB1 receptor activation critical
every aspect brain wiring development. mind, statement
make absolutely terrifying, least me, frankly, terrifying
well. statement is, current statistics cannabis use pregnant
mothers absolutely shocking. recent survey pregnant mothers
United States show 15%, one-five, 15% pregnant mothers report using cannabis
form another, either smoking likely ingestion edible,
aware negative effects smoking developing fetus, ingestion
edible increase THC and/or CBD pregnancy, me, say,
developmental neurobiologist is, frankly, scary. absolutely scary,
CB1 receptor not just minor player neural development. absolutely central
every critical aspect brain wiring development. Now, long-term implications
even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use
cannabis point pregnancy not yet known. is, say,
experiment ongoing. remiss didn't point data just
implore you, please, please, please, pregnant considering getting pregnant,
cannabis user, whether not using edibles, CBD user, please
whatever necessary not ingest cannabis smoke cannabis ingest CBD
pregnancy. Now, may certain clinical indications physician
OB/GYN, pediatrician will eventually pediatrician


child will prescribe CBD, although hard imagine are. contacted
number different pediatricians OB/GYNs not single one said
ever suggest, fact strongly discourage patients using cannabis
pregnancy. think advent edible forms cannabis,
combination THC CBD certain products, fact people view
CBD safer, not include, not have, say,
psychoactive effects THC does, led situation 15%
pregnant mothers using cannabis point pregnancy maybe even
frequently throughout pregnancy, effects developing fetus completely
unknown. recall cannabis THC CBD outcompete, meaning park

normal level pattern action, absolutely critical. cannot
encourage enough, rather, say, cannot discourage enough use
cannabis related compounds cannabis, edible smoked, certainly not
smoked, even edible pregnancy, certainly breastfeeding, lactating
mothers, also true. Recall cannabis THC CBD incredibly
lipophilic. fat soluble, get cells readily, cross
blood brain barrier. cross blood placental barrier. encountered
statistic, kind wipe eyes times. not believe it, yet
crosschecked number studies. others come little bit
lower somewhere like 13% 14%, come little bit higher,
average 15% striking shocking, don't know make message
clear. hope clear. Please not use cannabis, THC

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-

systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system
used tickled, not punched, tickled endogenous cannabinoids, every

potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery
smoking vaping vaping edible edible transdermal. Anyway,
go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major

02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural

THC combination THC CBD. simply way is.
said, now like focus attention direct effects cannabis has, either
way THC action way CBD action terms positive negative health effects
brain body, going explore first function age.
reason going related fact mentioned beginning
episode, CB1 CB2 receptors, two receptors cannabis
THC CBD CBN psychoactive compounds cannabis bind
actions present throughout development. Believe not,
present soon conception, CB1 CB2 receptors actually play
critical role development fetus. Now, might wonder is,
course, developing fetus doesn't necessarily expect see cannabis
exposed cannabis THC CBD. But, recall, endogenous cannabinoids
present adult brain body endogenous cannabinoids, turns out,
also present developing fetus. fact, endogenous cannabinoids present
much greater levels developing fetus child born, levels
endogenous cannabinoids actually go across development. find really
interesting. means endogenous cannabinoids activation CB1
CB2 receptors integral part neural development, going
become especially relevant considering whether not pregnant mothers
not use cannabis CBD, also points interesting biology
terms brain develops body develops. Now development
brain nervous system body fascinating vast literature, certainly far
vast cover today's episode, especially late hour were, will
future episode brain development. terms effects cannabis,
sufficient say cannabinoid receptors present active developing

cannabinoids mainly responsible actions cannabinoid receptors.
time, cannabinoid receptors specific effects
distinct effects later life, effects can largely explained terms

statement endogenous cannabinoids CB1 receptor activation critical
every aspect brain wiring development. mind, statement
make absolutely terrifying, least me, frankly, terrifying
well. statement is, current statistics cannabis use pregnant
mothers absolutely shocking. recent survey pregnant mothers
United States show 15%, one-five, 15% pregnant mothers report using cannabis
form another, either smoking likely ingestion edible,
aware negative effects smoking developing fetus, ingestion
edible increase THC and/or CBD pregnancy, me, say,
developmental neurobiologist is, frankly, scary. absolutely scary,
CB1 receptor not just minor player neural development. absolutely central
every critical aspect brain wiring development. Now, long-term implications
even short-term implications this, 15% mothers self-reporting use
cannabis point pregnancy not yet known. is, say,
experiment ongoing. remiss didn't point data just
implore you, please, please, please, pregnant considering getting pregnant,
cannabis user, whether not using edibles, CBD user, please
whatever necessary not ingest cannabis smoke cannabis ingest CBD
pregnancy. Now, may certain clinical indications physician
OB/GYN, pediatrician will eventually pediatrician


child will prescribe CBD, although hard imagine are. contacted
number different pediatricians OB/GYNs not single one said
ever suggest, fact strongly discourage patients using cannabis
pregnancy. think advent edible forms cannabis,
combination THC CBD certain products, fact people view
CBD safer, not include, not have, say,
psychoactive effects THC does, led situation 15%
pregnant mothers using cannabis point pregnancy maybe even
frequently throughout pregnancy, effects developing fetus completely
unknown. recall cannabis THC CBD outcompete, meaning park
receptor endogenous cannabinoids prevent endogenous cannabinoids
normal level pattern action, absolutely critical. cannot
encourage enough, rather, say, cannot discourage enough use
cannabis related compounds cannabis, edible smoked, certainly not
smoked, even edible pregnancy, certainly breastfeeding, lactating
mothers, also true. Recall cannabis THC CBD incredibly
lipophilic. fat soluble, get cells readily, cross
blood brain barrier. cross blood placental barrier. encountered
statistic, kind wipe eyes times. not believe it, yet
crosschecked number studies. others come little bit
lower somewhere like 13% 14%, come little bit higher,

clear. hope clear. Please not use cannabis, THC

02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance

related things including CBD, smoked edible pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
Now point need consider negative health effects
cannabis well documented peer-reviewed studies.
this, want return point made earlier, nothing say
relates directly issues legality. consider alcohol, instance, alcohol legal
areas world. certainly legal US, yet age limit
use. Typically, not available people 21 older. not say
certain people don't use age 21, not legal. illegal buy possess


alcohol, consume alcohol age 21, think good reason, brain
still developing. Likewise, can informed discussion cannabis
various components can fully acknowledge reality, one major
harms cannabis past legal ramifications cannabis illegal.
statement no longer controversial, not discussion
legalization non legalization. look scientific literature, epidemiological
literature, wonderful data Carleton University elsewhere Canada
showing many negative effects marijuana THC due criminal
justice system, itself, creation illicit drug businesses, creation
organized crime, creation number different features related illegality
cannabis. again, isn't topic today's episode,
acknowledged. time, need acknowledge compound,
drug whatever want call becomes legal, tendency assume
safe safe everybody. respect cannabis THC perhaps
even CBD, certainly THC cannabis smoked vaped consumed
edible form, simply not case. clear data pointing negative health
effects cannabis use THC use, again, not say not
positive effects mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
exist, will mention course, talked
those, creativity instance, et cetera. not acknowledge negative health
effects documented literature, overlooking
important data, especially relates development psychosis certain
individuals. So, said, strong data, will provide links
resources, pointing fact people chronic users cannabis,
using twice week more, time, levels anxiety actually increase,
true even individuals using strains cannabis,
influence cannabis, reduce anxiety. time, meaning course 12
months, well-documented effect anxiety relief cannabis
THC initially brought, less less potent. people need smoke
ingest THC order achieve level anxiety relief,
cases, switch anxiety relief increase anxiety, again, increase
anxiety, not just drug not consumed, also influence
drug. be? go back understanding CB1
receptor potency THC binds CB1 receptor. THC


brought system again, meaning twice week more, binding
THC, CB1 receptor, eventually causes habituation attenuation entire
process binding receptor creating psychoactive effects. initially
creates anxiety relief, time, affinity receptor doesn't change, meaning
can still park slot lot affinity, lot strength, fewer
receptors available, signaling downstream receptors
becomes less less robust. Now topic didn't get much detail
today, didn't want include even biological detail, CB1 receptor
so-called G protein-coupled receptor. mouthful, G protein-coupled
receptor basically like bucket brigade. receptors brain
body something, chemical binds them, receptor direct
action, like opens allows stuff rush cell, increases excitability
cell, called fast effects, G protein-coupled receptors, CB1 G protein-
coupled receptor, like bucket brigade kick off process
one molecule handed off another molecule handed off
another molecule. long chain cascade events. long chains
cascades events lot opportunity regulation, adjustment. Receptor
systems brain body, especially receptor systems like cannabinoid system
used tickled, not punched, tickled endogenous cannabinoids, every
binds, effect, certainly not bound incredible
potency THC coming system. Well
systems eventually, time, adjust body
cells can achieve so-called homeostasis. people using THC
twice week, ends happening G protein-coupled receptors
downstream signaling mechanisms start adjust themselves, requires
drug, either higher dosages frequent use, lot positive
effects, so-called decrease anxiety, increased focus, increased creativity,
starts wane, starts dissipate, people wonder use
much cannabis just achieve fraction effect used able
achieve even lower dose. anxiety getting worse time, anxiety
drug use outside drug use. people work around try
work around using varying strains cannabis changing pattern delivery
smoking vaping vaping edible edible transdermal. Anyway,
go lot gymnastics writhing seeking, nonetheless, anxiety


increases time. Also, clear depression increases time
especially, surprising me, especially individuals not depressed
outset use. words, didn't start using cannabis
depressed, rather depression starts emerge consequence
cannabis THC use. serious, fact, now know, based really solid
epidemiological evidence, depression not strong predictor seeking
cannabis. doesn't drive terribly many people seek cannabis use,

02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition Psychosis

cannabis use, itself, makes people four times likelier develop chronic major
depression. anxiety increasing, depression increasing, turns
especially relevant important young people. say that? Well, look
data, again, think strongest data data come
Canadian system. done really beautiful controlled studies. really hope
invite people arranged ran studies guests onto
Huberman Lab Podcast. look data Canada, look
data Northern Europe US, find probability
somebody will use cannabis go use chronically, correlates strongly
age. instance, highest degree cannabis use among
individuals 16 24 years old. fact, individuals 16 24 years old,
particular, students people working, surprising, unemployed
populations, young, 16 24, least young, student
working doubles likelihood somebody going use cannabis regular
basis, twice per week. typical age initiating cannabis use nowadays
19 years old, 18.7, 20% people age bracket, 16 24
years old, using cannabis daily, either vaping, smoking edible.
enormous number, least read. enormous number,
really serious concern. ages 16 24, cannabinoid receptors still
available. not strongly driven endogenous cannabinoids,
ingestion THC and/or CBD, downstream effects signaling within
cells data point creating much, much higher likelihood
developing major depression, severe anxiety psychosis later ages.
clear, cannabis use, ages 16 24, males females


increasing anxiety, increasing depression immediate years within one
year's time so, much people using cannabis ongoing attempt
reduce anxiety reduce depression, addition that, cannabis
use, signaling mechanisms involved predisposing
individuals psychosis later life. look individuals start using cannabis,
even younger, age 14, even young 12, probability psychosis later life,
particular schizophrenic schizophrenic-like episodes doubles,
really serious concern, completely aside so-called positive effects
beneficial effects cannabis people might derive occasional use adults,
meaning people older 25. person older 25, eats
edible every while, smokes cannabis every while, people
love make argument, not bad alcohol, frankly, terrible

very, careful concerned long-term effects

unlike lot drugs, rate cannabis use strongly related dangerous
people perceive cannabis be. Now, might seem obvious, one hand,
think something very, dangerous, expect probability
somebody use very, low, think something safe,
probability high. isn't necessarily case. think it,
cannabis unique instance nowadays hearing, yes, becoming

circumstances, aren't just hearing cannabis safe, not
just implied cannabis safer, many people talking

cannabis. realize saying going upset people there,
know number people fought hard legalization
process, want acknowledge that. also want acknowledge many known

not demonizing anybody using cannabis, want make point simply
directly. far away different circumstance brain individual

human being, one portion becoming functional human being, certainly
essential one. relies fine tuning neural circuitry
talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people
starting use cannabis age bracket 16 24. Many
functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use
age bracket 16 24, twice likely use individuals start using
cannabis individuals. Plus, general perception there,
way cannabis discussed media sports figures celebrities
politicians, et cetera, not bad alcohol maybe not bad
maybe even health benefits, essentially setting system
young people far likely adopt continue cannabis use

talking now, abundantly clear cannabis THC particular,
dramatically disrupt processes. isn't clear enough, just
statements, like point particular paper. one impactful
papers area recent years. paper published "Lancet Psychiatry"
2022. Title "Association Cannabis Potency "with Mental Ill Health Addiction,
Systematic Review." number important points fine paper.
"Lancet Psychiatry" one premier medical journals there, evaluated
huge number studies. actually looked 4,000 studies.
selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people
starting use cannabis age bracket 16 24. Many
functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use
age bracket 16 24, twice likely use individuals start using

way cannabis discussed media sports figures celebrities

selected ones rigorous terms study design analysis
rigor conclusions, looked early use cannabis impacted later
probability development psychosis psychiatric conditions,
takeaways study clear. First all, chronic cannabis use,
twice per week, consistently associated mental health disorders.
pulling phrases directly paper. Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis
use frequent twice per week, associated four times risk
psychosis later life, particular, schizophrenia bipolar-like episodes. Now,
done episode bipolar disorder. also called bipolar depression. not yet
done one schizophrenia, bipolar disorder schizophrenia very,
strong genetic component. 30, three-zero, 30 times greater likelihood
bipolar disorder first relative bipolar disorder. then,
also case using cannabis, especially adolescents teen years,
age 25, create four times greater risk psychosis
predisposition bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia. Now, don't hear much
media. paper got attention got swept away. don't
think intentional sweeping way. just lot events world
well know. think particularly important set findings, obviously,
looking many studies, distills strongest findings
really pulls consistent messages arriving different studies.
point out, again, paraphrasing here, first systematic review
association cannabis potency, data point clear conclusion,
potent THC concentration, higher probability developing
psychosis major depressive episode major anxiety disorder later life.


particular concern, know, absolutely clear
fact advent new strains cannabis, engineering
availability cannabis much higher potency, meaning THC potency, risk
psychosis going likely continue going unless something done
reduce frequency cannabis use zero, ideally, low frequency,
low potency adolescence teens people age 25 younger. know lot
people don't want hear message, first all, alarming, second
all, mentioned earlier, statistics tell us greatest number people

functional areas life. students, employed, et cetera.
couple fact frequent adopters cannabis use
