00:08:35 Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception

two free pillows. now discussion Dr. Charles Zuker, Charles, thank
much joining today. - pleasure. - want ask many things
related taste gustatory perception, maybe start off
worked number different topics neuroscience, not just taste, think
perception, rather, say, world people think
perception, different sensation leads experience life
terms vision, hearing, taste, et cetera? - brain extra ordinary organ
weights maybe 2% body mass. Yet consumes anywhere 25 30%
energy oxygen. gets transformed mind mind
changes human condition. make, changes, transforms fear courage,
conformity creativity, sadness happiness. hell happen? Now,
challenge brain faces world made real things. know,
glass, cord microphone, brain made
neurons understand electrical signals. transform reality
nothing electrical signals now need represent world? process
can operationally define perception, senses, say olfactory,
taste, vision can straightforwardly separate detection perception, detection
happens take sugar molecule, put tongue
set specific cells now sense sugar molecule detection, haven't
perceived anything yet. just cells tongue, interacting
chemical. now cell gets activated sends signal brain now


detection gets transformed perception. trying understand
happens. maniacal drive, entire career neuroscience.
brain ultimately transform detection perception can guide actions
behaviors?

again, think world Marcus too, think right broadly speaking,
categorize lot behaviors falling two categories 100%


likely case animals wild choices not necessarily binary,
unique distinct. want eat this? want kill that?
want go there? want go here? humans deviated world long
ago. learned experience life things not doing. -

likelihood animal wild will enjoy eating something bitter inconceivable,
yet love tonic water. enjoy, like living edge. love enjoying
experiences makes us human. goes beyond simple set categories,
yummy, yukky, ah, cares. think not bad palette, think
overly reductionist certainly humans do. - agree. since

first date, happen? want begin explore things
brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone
number sushi Ota, please? give phone, least
old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term
memory. remember birthdays every one children rest
lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change
signal travels tongue brain normal animal versus animal
now transformed sweet attractive immersive.
way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function
state. - number questions related that, relate idea
context, mentioned flavor distinct taste flavor
involves smell, texture, temperature, features, uni, sea urchin
good example of, can sense texture. actually it's, nah, won't describe


reminds of, various reasons. ability place context into, insert context
perception, rather insert perception context powerful.
element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.
aversive. olfactory system, claimed can smell millions different
odors, yet part, none innate predetermined meaning,
olfactory system, meaning imposed learning experience. - Even smell
smoke? - going give you, going make differently. handful
millions odors claimed that, immediately tell
adversive attractive. - Vomit. - vomit, not correct can
assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory
experience. accommodates two important things. case taste,
neurons every station sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,
five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific
context now gives meaning. Now go back original question then.
clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural
organization, taste, just told predetermined, hardwired,
predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain
system, positive valance emerges negative signal sufficient
create positive association. case beer, course, alcohol.
feeling good get sufficient say, want this.
case coffee, course, caffeine activating whole group
neurotransmitter systems give high associated coffee. yes,
taste system changeable. malleable, subject subjected learning
experience. like olfactory system restricted
goal allow get nutrients survive. goal olfactory
system different. used, not case, every animal species
identify friend versus foe, identify mate, identify ecological niches want
in. plays broad role requires set organized
function different type context. Taste about, can get nutrients
need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature
system way approached it. think important people
hear that, everybody, mystified empathy love, et cetera.
fairness that,

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -

brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose
gut cells susceptible things healthier us. - good. Excellent
idea. think important goal will come strategy identify

big issue, can really a,

absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

likely case animals wild choices not necessarily binary,
unique distinct. want eat this? want kill that?
want go there? want go here? humans deviated world long

likelihood animal wild will enjoy eating something bitter inconceivable,
yet love tonic water. enjoy, like living edge. love enjoying

on. one key things science, know, ensuring always
ask right question possibility answering it.
question cannot tractable reduced experimental path helps resolve

important problem want study. Make sense? - first person perspective,
yes. hardest question, important question going try

like understand brain makes someone great philanthropist.

questions brain function, can cover many aspects brain,
need choose problem affords window. way can ask
questions get answers among senses capacity
transforming detection perception stored memories creating emotions,
giving different actions perceptions function internal state.
know, hungry, things taste differently sated, how,
why? taste something, now remember amazing meal
first date, happen? want begin explore things
brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone

old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term

lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change

way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make

million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,

many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain

need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature

lot listeners podcast will heard gut brain axis.
lot misconceptions gut brain axis. Many people think means
think stomach quote unquote, gut feeling aspect, love
talk aspects gut brain signaling drive change perceptions

begin maybe stating that, brain needs monitor state every one


organs, it. way brain can ensure every one

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food

presence bell alone will start salivate. will call neurologically
speaking anticipatory response. Okay, understand it. get it. know,
neurons brain form association now represent food coming.
sending signal motor neurons go salivary glands squeeze them.
release saliva know food coming, even remarkable
animals also releasing insulin response bell. Okay.
illustrates one part two-way highway, highway going down, somehow
brain created associations neurons brain now no food

01:36:23 Vagus Nerve

- Please, please. No, mean, vagus nerve popular culture kind
converted single meaning calming pathways, mostly actually
tip hat yogic community among first talk vagus
on, calming pathways, so-called parasympathetic pathways within
vagus. think learn vagus, seems like

counter idea just way calming oneself down. - also course,
mean, one cautious that. vagus nerve made many
thousands fibers, individual fibers make gigantic bundle. likely
speaking, fibers carries slightly different meaning, not
necessarily one one, maybe five 10, five 20, right, carry meaning
associated specific task. group fibers telling brain

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega

that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,

think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving

one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things

next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term

food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change

way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.
aversive. olfactory system, claimed can smell millions different
odors, yet part, none innate predetermined meaning,
olfactory system, meaning imposed learning experience. - Even smell

assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory
experience. accommodates two important things. case taste,
neurons every station sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,
five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific
context now gives meaning. Now go back original question then.
clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural
organization, taste, just told predetermined, hardwired,
predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain

create positive association. case beer, course, alcohol.
feeling good get sufficient say, want this.
case coffee, course, caffeine activating whole group

need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb

animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose
gut cells susceptible things healthier us. - good. Excellent
idea. think important goal will come strategy identify
means allow us modulate circuits way certainly those,
big issue, can really a,

01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes Behavior

- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different

first date, happen? want begin explore things
brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,

even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad

Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia

recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving

one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful

vision, topic love spend day taste fascinating. First
all, like know migrated studying vision studying taste.
perhaps description, highlight us think
think sense taste. - goal understand,
highlighted brain magic, know part might wonder,
ideally, like help contribute understand it. know encode
decode emotions? encode decode memories actions?
make decisions? transform detection perception? list goes
on. one key things science, know, ensuring always
ask right question possibility answering it.
question cannot tractable reduced experimental path helps resolve
it, end really fun science, not necessarily answering
important problem want study. Make sense? - first person perspective,
yes. hardest question, important question going try
answer. - got it. example will understand neural basis
empathy. - [Andrew] big market that. - 100%, wouldn't even know.
mean, molecular level, do. circuits brain create
sense? no clue it. can come ways think it,


like understand brain makes someone great philanthropist.
neural basis love? wouldn't even know begin. want begin study
questions brain function, can cover many aspects brain,
need choose problem affords window. way can ask
questions get answers among senses capacity
transforming detection perception stored memories creating emotions,
giving different actions perceptions function internal state.
know, hungry, things taste differently sated, how,
why? taste something, now remember amazing meal
first date, happen? want begin explore things
brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone

next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term

food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change

way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

good example of, can sense texture. actually it's, nah, won't describe


reminds of, various reasons. ability place context into, insert context

element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make

five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific

clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural

predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain

need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain

brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega

- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,

like understand brain makes someone great philanthropist.
neural basis love? wouldn't even know begin. want begin study
questions brain function, can cover many aspects brain,
need choose problem affords window. way can ask
questions get answers among senses capacity
transforming detection perception stored memories creating emotions,
giving different actions perceptions function internal state.
know, hungry, things taste differently sated, how,
why? taste something, now remember amazing meal
first date, happen? want begin explore things
brain does, felt choose sensory system affords degree
simplicity way input output relationships put together. way
still can used ask every one problems brain ultimately
compute, encode decode. remarkable taste system time
began working nothing known molecular basis
taste. know, knew taste usually defined five
basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, umami Japanese word
means yummy, delicious. nearly every animal species, taste amino
acids. humans, mostly associated taste MSG, monosodium
glutamate, one amino acid particular. - just way example, foods
rich umami evoking stimulation? - Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh,
great, great flavor enhancer. enriches sensory experience.
beautiful thing system lines input limited five. know, sweet,
sour, bitter, salt umami, predetermined meaning,
born liking sugar disliking bitter. no choice. hard wire systems,
course can learn dislike sugar like bitters, while, take
humans question, hundred percent predetermined. born
specific valance value taste sweet, umami low salt attractive
taste qualities. evoke appetitive responses, want consume them.

00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste

bitter sour innately, predetermined aversive. - interrupt
just briefly ask question exact point something appetitive


taste aversive hardwired, can assume
sensation bitter activation bitter receptors mouth activates
neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens
activation bitter molecule bitter sensing cell tongue. - incredible. -
again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,

going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context



- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,

neural circuit causes closing mouth, retraction tongue retraction
body taste something sweet might actually induce licking? -
100%, got it, activation receptors tongue recognize sweet
versus ones recognize bitter activate entire behavioral program.
program can refer appetitiveness aversion composed many different
subroutines, case bitter easy actually look at, see happening
animals. first thing stop licking. put unhappy face,
squint eyes start gagging. entire thing happens

again, magic brain, able encode decode
extraordinary

00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor

actions behaviors response nothing simple, unique sensory stimuli.
Now, let say pallet five basic tastes accommodates dietary needs
organism. Sweet ensure get right amount energy, umami,
ensure get proteins essential nutrient, salt, three appetitive ones
ensure maintain electrolyte balance, bitter prevent ingestion toxic
nauseous chemicals, nearly bitter tasting things wild bad you,
sour, likely prevent ingestion spoil acid, fermented foods. it.
pallet deal with. Now, course, difference basic taste
flavor, flavor whole experience. Flavor combination multiple tastes coming
together together smell, texture, temperature, look gives
call full sensory experience. But, scientists need
reduce problem basic elements. can begin break apart
put back together. think sense taste, try figure
lines information go tongue brain signal
integrate trigger different behaviors.
look individual qualities, give animals sweet, give
bitter. give sour, avoid mixes first stage discovery
clarity trying extract can hopefully meaningfully


make difference able figure easy goes B C D,
make sense? - Yeah, almost like primary colors create full array
color spectrum.

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone
number sushi Ota, please? give phone, least
old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term
memory. remember birthdays every one children rest
lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change
signal travels tongue brain normal animal versus animal
now transformed sweet attractive immersive.
way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

context, mentioned flavor distinct taste flavor
involves smell, texture, temperature, features, uni, sea urchin
good example of, can sense texture. actually it's, nah, won't describe


reminds of, various reasons. ability place context into, insert context
perception, rather insert perception context powerful.
element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.
aversive. olfactory system, claimed can smell millions different
odors, yet part, none innate predetermined meaning,
olfactory system, meaning imposed learning experience. - Even smell

assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory
experience. accommodates two important things. case taste,
neurons every station sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,
five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific
context now gives meaning. Now go back original question then.
clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural
organization, taste, just told predetermined, hardwired,
predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain
system, positive valance emerges negative signal sufficient
create positive association. case beer, course, alcohol.
feeling good get sufficient say, want this.
case coffee, course, caffeine activating whole group
neurotransmitter systems give high associated coffee. yes,
taste system changeable. malleable, subject subjected learning
experience. like olfactory system restricted
goal allow get nutrients survive. goal olfactory
system different. used, not case, every animal species
identify friend versus foe, identify mate, identify ecological niches want
in. plays broad role requires set organized
function different type context. Taste about, can get nutrients
need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature
system way approached it. think important people
hear that, everybody, mystified empathy love, et cetera.
fairness that,

01:09:14 Integration Odor & Taste, Influence Behavior & Emotion

going ask sort high level question abstract question. based

taste given two systems different? - Yes, come together,
ultimately place brain come together integrate two


call sensory experience. tell experiment

anticipated, hypothesized maybe area brain mouse,
corresponding area brain humans, integrates odor taste. known as,
term normally used multisensory integration. true,
following experiment. can train mouse lick sweet. guess correctly,
supposed sweet. go now right port, right side,
get water reward. go lift, sweet, incorrect
get no reward actually get time out. Now mice thirsty,
motivated perform. repeat task hundred times, hundred trials,
incredibly enough, animal learned recognize sweet execute right
action. action, now told animal tasting. can
make interesting can give sweet bitter say, sweet go
right bitter go left. train mice 90%
accuracy, it'll tell you, randomize now stimuli, sweet
bitter? can now experiment, now mix taste odor say,
got odor alone, go right push lever mice. get taste alone, go
part push lever. get two together, something
else. train mice, mice able now report back
sensing taste alone, odor alone, mix. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - Now can
go brain mice go area now uncover, discover
side multisensory integration taste odor, silence it, prevent
activated experimentally. area really represented integration
two, animals still able recognize taste alone. still
able recognize alone, incapable now recognize mix,
exactly predicted. exactly get. right? - brain basically

lot listeners podcast will heard gut brain axis.
lot misconceptions gut brain axis. Many people think means
think stomach quote unquote, gut feeling aspect, love
talk aspects gut brain signaling drive change perceptions

begin maybe stating that, brain needs monitor state every one


organs, it. way brain can ensure every one

give example again, brain can take refer contextual

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food

presence bell alone will start salivate. will call neurologically
speaking anticipatory response. Okay, understand it. get it. know,
neurons brain form association now represent food coming.
sending signal motor neurons go salivary glands squeeze them.
release saliva know food coming, even remarkable
animals also releasing insulin response bell. Okay.
illustrates one part two-way highway, highway going down, somehow
brain created associations neurons brain now no food

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving

02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context



- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,

00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception

- Exactly. - ask first second third stages taste
flavor perception, idea may five? - is,
example, fat? - love taste. - Oh, love fat too. love texture
fat, especially slightly burnt, like South America, visited Buenos Aries,
found end meal, take steak, trimming off edge
steak, burn slightly, serve back me. thought disgusting.
tasted delightful. - is. - nothing quite like it. - goes back
notion like live edge. like things
not doing, Andrew, hand, look muscles. - don't suggest
anyone eat pure fat. listeners podcast will immediately, sure there'll
YouTube video soon like eating pure fat. not ketogenic diet, et cetera,
fat tasty evidenced obesity problem exists country. - talk
that. know, little bit gut brain axis, think it'll important
cover side taste system. missing taste, one fat,
although like clearly highlighted lot fat taste quotation marks really
feeling fat rolling tongue. compelling argument lot
call fat taste, really mechanosensory, somatosensory cells, cells
not responding taste, responding mechanical stimulation fat
molecules rolling tongue gives perception fat. - love idea
perception fat, regardless whether not dedicated receptor
fat, mostly evoking sensations imagery taste slightly burnt fat. -
example. another one argue metallic taste. know, know
exactly tastes like. know, ask explain it, will hard time,
palettes color can allow define it? wouldn't easy,
know precisely tastes like, take take penny, put mouth know
tastes like. - blood. - blood. another good example.
really receptor metallic taste nothing magical combination
activation existing lines, think lines information, just separate lines, like


keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving

- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories

keys piano. Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, play key activate
one chord. one chord case piano leads note, know tune
case taste leads action behavior, play many
together. something emerges different one pieces.
possible metallic, example, represents combination activity just
right ratio makes lines. - Makes sense.

00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors

actually provides perfect, example piano provides perfect segue
like touch next, describe sequence neural
events leading perceptual event taste. certain somewhere
embed answer question whether not indeed different taste
receptors distributed different locations tongue. elsewhere mouth. -
Yes. start banking old tale myth. - came that? -
many views, prevalent original drawing
describing sensitivity tongue different tastes. imagine can take Q-Tip,
thought experiment, going dip Q-Tip salt quinine
something bitter glucose something sweet. going take Q-tip, ask
stick tongue start moving around tongue ask you,
feel? going change concentration amount salt
amount bitter ask, can get sort map sensitivity different
tastes? argument emerged good likelihood
data simply mistranslated drawn. course, led entire
industry. way maximize wine experience, now going
form vessel going drink acts maximally
receptors happen. Now, no tongue map. right, taste buds
distributed various parts tongue. map distribution taste
bud, taste bud around hundred taste receptor cells. taste
receptor cells can five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
part, taste buds representation five taste qualities. Now no
question slight bias taste, like bitter, particularly rich
back tongue. teleological basis that, actually biological basis
that. last line defense swallow something bad.


make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone
number sushi Ota, please? give phone, least
old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term
memory. remember birthdays every one children rest
lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change
signal travels tongue brain normal animal versus animal
now transformed sweet attractive immersive.
way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

good example of, can sense texture. actually it's, nah, won't describe


reminds of, various reasons. ability place context into, insert context

element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.

assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory
experience. accommodates two important things. case taste,
neurons every station sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,
five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific
context now gives meaning. Now go back original question then.
clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural
organization, taste, just told predetermined, hardwired,
predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain
system, positive valance emerges negative signal sufficient
create positive association. case beer, course, alcohol.
feeling good get sufficient say, want this.
case coffee, course, caffeine activating whole group
neurotransmitter systems give high associated coffee. yes,
taste system changeable. malleable, subject subjected learning

system different. used, not case, every animal species
identify friend versus foe, identify mate, identify ecological niches want
in. plays broad role requires set organized
function different type context. Taste about, can get nutrients
need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature
system way approached it. think important people
hear that, everybody, mystified empathy love, et cetera.
fairness that,

experienced sides equation myself. describing
tasting wine, typical example people inhale
drink it, me, seems like something people might able relate
to, certain things people smell delicious. Even mothers describing smell

babies necks, magical place. - neck. - back
neck. - go. - Oh goodness. grandchild now. know
exactly what, Rio, name, smells like. - Okay. beautiful examples.
always fun think beautiful positively appetitive examples. smell

taste given two systems different? - Yes, come together,
ultimately place brain come together integrate two


call sensory experience. tell experiment

setting for, actually different- - trying learn things. - Yeah,
know. - However- - right, listen, weaned system a, say
second. Actually recorded podcast recently prominent podcast
Lex Friedman Podcast. made reference so-called New York neuroscience
mafia. won't say whether not sitting presence New York
neuroscience mafia member, event, know sorts ribbing
provide listening, kind hazing happens. Benevolent hazing
academia. target. - course, it's- - sign love. - Exactly. - going
tell that. - always science end, right. interesting
question. Look, am, don't know answer don't even know explore
way will rigorously teach me, eh, but. - Let tell asking.
offer experiment love see someone lab do. thinking
saliva. - No, no, no, know, can figure out. - Obviously.
question whether not saliva fed state distinct saliva
unfed state, modulates sensitivity, response. - not sensitivity,
experiment done. - [Andrew] done. answer no. -
not. way experiment use artificial saliva. -
thing? know artificial tears, but. - No, no, we, don't mean
go Walgreens get, mean, we, laboratory, know


composition saliva can make thing, can take taste cells
culture tongue wash out, can apply artificial saliva.
happens system engineered desensitize, become agnostic
saliva become invisible. no difference state animal. -
Great, well, reason experiments. - [Charles] Yeah, absolutely. -
doesn't defeat grand hypothesis. just pure curiosity. - know curiosity
kills cat? - do, saves career scientists every single time. -
drives us, absolutely. - Every single time. - story lives. - Exactly.

01:28:10 Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response

not saliva apparently not, internal state aspects
this, internal milieu relevant autonomic, sleep
awake, stress. One questions got hundreds people
solicited questions advance episode crave sugar
stressed, instance, contextual, basic elements- -
makes us feel good way, get that. answer. -
Soothing. - activates, going generically refer reward pleasure centers
way dramatically, changes internal state. eat gallon
ice cream depressed? fact, good segue go
entire different world body telling brain need important things like
sugar fat, anyways, go ahead, going ask something. - Well, no,
like discuss basic elements internal state particular, ones
conscious detection. a, course segue incredible
landscape, gut brain axis, think 15 years ago almost a, maybe
posters meeting. now believe others, companies,
companies, active research programs, beautiful work. Maybe
describe work others involved in.
lot listeners podcast will heard gut brain axis.
lot misconceptions gut brain axis. Many people think means
think stomach quote unquote, gut feeling aspect, love
talk aspects gut brain signaling drive change perceptions
behaviors completely beneath awareness. - Yes. Excellent. let
begin maybe stating that, brain needs monitor state every one


organs, it. way brain can ensure every one
organs working together way healthy physiology. Now,
monitoring brain known long time, think hadn't fully
appreciated two-way highway brain not monitoring,
now modulating back body needs do. includes way
monitoring frequency heartbeats way inspiration aspirations
breeding cycle operate happens ingest sugar fat. Now, let
give example again, brain can take refer contextual
associations transform incredible changes physiology metabolism.
Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food
coming. Now, first incredible finding made fact dog now
presence bell alone will start salivate. will call neurologically
speaking anticipatory response. Okay, understand it. get it. know,
neurons brain form association now represent food coming.
sending signal motor neurons go salivary glands squeeze them.
release saliva know food coming, even remarkable
animals also releasing insulin response bell. Okay.
illustrates one part two-way highway, highway going down, somehow
brain created associations neurons brain now no food
coming send signal somehow way pancreas now says
release insulin sugar coming down. goes back magic brain.
never ending source joy intrigue. hell this? mean,
neurons. - share delight fascination. not day lecture
talks better others talk don't sit back just think,
absolutely amazing. - How. - amazing. - Now past, don't know, dozen
years great force last five years now, main highway

now refer gut brain axis. highway specific bundle nerves
emerged Vagal ganglia, nodus ganglia. vagus nerve
innervating majority organs body. monitoring function,

01:36:23 Vagus Nerve

- Please, please. No, mean, vagus nerve popular culture kind
converted single meaning calming pathways, mostly actually
tip hat yogic community among first talk vagus
on, calming pathways, so-called parasympathetic pathways within
vagus. think learn vagus, seems like
entire set neural connections, opposed one nerve. just wanted just mention
think lot people heard vagus turns experimentally
laboratory, many neuroscientists will stimulate vagus create states
alertness arousal animals, even people believe not close dying
going coma stimulation vagus one ways wake brain
counter idea just way calming oneself down. - also course,
mean, one cautious that. vagus nerve made many
thousands fibers, individual fibers make gigantic bundle. likely
speaking, fibers carries slightly different meaning, not
necessarily one one, maybe five 10, five 20, right, carry meaning
associated specific task. group fibers telling brain
state heart. group fiber telling brain state gut.
telling brain nutritional state, this, pancreas, lungs.
again, make simple example, keys piano. Yes,
right. lot data, showing activating entire vagal bundle

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose

big issue, can really a,

01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes Behavior

02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context



- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,
every four weeks. - enjoy it? - Oh, love it. Part haven't

make sure back tongue plenty bad news receptors
get activated, can trigger gagging reflex get rid
otherwise may kill you. - Makes good sense. - notion sweet front
salt side. not real. Go ahead. - Oh, just going ask, first all,
thank dispelling myth. will propagate information far wide
can. 'Cause think number one myth related taste. one is,
taste receptors anywhere else mouth, instance, lips? -
palette, palette, not lips. pharynx back oral cavity,
tongue palette palette rich sweet receptors. -
pay attention next time eat something sweet. - pull up, yeah.
Now important thing receptors five, detectors,
molecules send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, receptors, proteins found
surface taste receptor cells interact chemicals.
interact, trigger cascade events, biochemical events, inside cell now
sends electrical signal says sweet here, salt here. Now
receptors laboratory identify receptors five basic taste classes,
sweet, bitter, salt, umami, recently sour. Now completing palette. can
now use receptors really map found tongue
rigorous way. no longer using Q-Tip trying figure
feeling, rather tongue. not guess. now
physical map says sweet receptors found here. bitter found here.
that, find fact,

00:39:34 Burning Tongue & Perception

every taste bud throughout oral cavity receptors basic taste
classes. - Amazing. turns out, sure tell us important terms
thinking brain computes, encodes decodes thing call taste.
going inject quick question sure many people's minds
get back biological circuit, many people, including myself, familiar
experience drinking sip tea coffee hot, burning
tongue way describe it. - Horrible. - Horrible. disrupting sense
taste period time afterward. experienced phenomenon,
unfortunate phenomenon destroyed taste receptors regenerate,


somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long

So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high

distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens

somehow used temperature distort function circuit no longer taste
way before? - Excellent question. answer both. turns
taste receptors live around two weeks, this, way, makes sense
organ, tongue, continuously exposed everything
range nicest, horrible possible things. - Use
imagination. - need make sure cells always coming back
way can reexperience world right way organs
underlying logic. gut, intestines way. Amazing.
Again, receiving everything ingest. God forbid there,
spiciest horrible tastings delicious. again, intestinal
cells whose role ultimately take nutrients bring body.
Also renew very, fast cycle, olfactory neurons nose example.
A, yes, burning lot cells those. good news
going come back, know burn tea,
come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, cells not renewing
timeframe. not listening needs. internal clock.
really affecting, damaging way can recover.
come back also damage somatosensory cells.
results feel things, not taste things. wait half hour so,
goodness, thank God, back normal. - time, don't even
notice transition realizing,

00:42:54 “Meaning” Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence

tell me, later, ask relationship odor taste.
next step, along circuit, assume ingest some, keep simple.
sweet taste. - make even simpler. time, perhaps
informative, compare contrast sweet bitter follow lines
tongue brain. first thing two evoke diametrically opposed
behaviors. come two sensory experience represent polar
opposites, will sweet video. not two colors represent polar
opposites say black white, polar opposites, one detects
one thing. one detects everything, don't evoke different
behaviors. - Even political parties overlap. - Sweet bitter two


opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone
number sushi Ota, please? give phone, least
old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term
memory. remember birthdays every one children rest
lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change
signal travels tongue brain normal animal versus animal
now transformed sweet attractive immersive.
way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function
state. - number questions related that, relate idea
context, mentioned flavor distinct taste flavor
involves smell, texture, temperature, features, uni, sea urchin
good example of, can sense texture. actually it's, nah, won't describe


reminds of, various reasons. ability place context into, insert context
perception, rather insert perception context powerful.
element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.
aversive. olfactory system, claimed can smell millions different
odors, yet part, none innate predetermined meaning,
olfactory system, meaning imposed learning experience. - Even smell
smoke? - going give you, going make differently. handful
millions odors claimed that, immediately tell
adversive attractive. - Vomit. - vomit, not correct can
assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory
experience. accommodates two important things. case taste,
neurons every station sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,
five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,
olfactory cortex, capacity associate every specific
context now gives meaning. Now go back original question then.
clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural
organization, taste, just told predetermined, hardwired,
predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean not modulated learning
experience. means born liking sweet disliking bitter.
many examples plasticity, beer one example. learn love
beer coffee. associated gain system gain
system, positive valance emerges negative signal sufficient
create positive association. case beer, course, alcohol.
feeling good get sufficient say, want this.
case coffee, course, caffeine activating whole group
neurotransmitter systems give high associated coffee. yes,
taste system changeable. malleable, subject subjected learning
experience. like olfactory system restricted
goal allow get nutrients survive. goal olfactory
system different. used, not case, every animal species
identify friend versus foe, identify mate, identify ecological niches want
in. plays broad role requires set organized
function different type context. Taste about, can get nutrients
need survive? can ensure attracted ones need?
adverse ones going kill us, overly simplistic reductionist.
think illustrates huge difference two chemo sensory systems. -
don't think overly simplicity. think illustrates key intractable nature
system way approached it. think important people
hear that, everybody, mystified empathy love, et cetera.
fairness that,

01:09:14 Integration Odor & Taste, Influence Behavior & Emotion

going ask sort high level question abstract question. based


conversation former girlfriend talking chemistry
individuals. complicated topic one hand. hand,
quite simple certain people, whatever reason, evoke tremendous sense
arousal, lack better word, two people, one hope, least

I, taste said something, think part maybe
irritate bit, commenting not experience other,
someone now excited good terms. said,
"What think is, thing chemistry?" maybe trying to- - Warn

something smell something actually taste, literally taste
somebody's breath." way described it. thought
interesting example number reasons, particular, gets
merging odor taste. also idea course context new

whole context there, experience odor somebody's
breath aversive. Not identify aversive. - just
didn't like it. - just didn't like it. - associated
added odors trigger negative aversive reaction, way. - Absolutely.
certain perfumes aversive. - [Charles] got it. -
sense, can recall sense skin, foods, et cetera, immensely appetitive.
experienced sides equation myself. describing
tasting wine, typical example people inhale
drink it, me, seems like something people might able relate
to, certain things people smell delicious. Even mothers describing smell
baby's head. - mother, us. - [Andrew] course, men too, yeah. - mean
babies necks, magical place. - neck. - back
neck. - go. - Oh goodness. grandchild now. know
exactly what, Rio, name, smells like. - Okay. beautiful examples.
always fun think beautiful positively appetitive examples. smell
back grandson's neck. mean, get specific that, not
lot specific exactly. going terms combination odor
taste given two systems different? - Yes, come together,
ultimately place brain come together integrate two


call sensory experience. tell experiment
demonstrates this. think good the, audience get

answers. know olfactory cortex brain. know
taste cortex brain. two different places. can go

got odor alone, go right push lever mice. get taste alone, go
part push lever. get two together, something
else. train mice, mice able now report back
sensing taste alone, odor alone, mix. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - Now can
go brain mice go area now uncover, discover

two, animals still able recognize taste alone. still
able recognize alone, incapable now recognize mix,
exactly predicted. exactly get. right? - brain basically

sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens

Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going

opposite ends sensory spectrum, now, taste can defined two features.
Again, reductionist, reducing way think easier follow
signal. two features quality valance valance little V
say Spanish, V, means value experience, right?
case stimuli take sweet, sweet quality, identity,
will refer taste sweet. know exactly tastes like,
sweet also positive valance, makes incredibly attractive appetitive,
attractive appetitive, tell second independent identity
quality. fact, able engineer animals completely remove
valance stimuli. animals can taste sweet, can recognize sweet,
no longer attractive. just one chemical stimuli.
identity valence encoded two separate parts brain. case
bitter, again, one hand identity, quality, know exactly
bitter tastes like. - can taste now, even describe it. - also valence
negative valance evokes aversive behaviors. on? -
Absolutely. comes mind. remember telling kids recently going
go get ice cream interesting. looked started smacking
like, actually. - anticipatory response. Absolutely. talk
gut brain maybe get there. signals, follow now, two
lines, really like two separate keys two ends keyboard.
press one key activate cord. activate sweet cells throughout
oral cavity. converge group sweet neurons next station,
still outside brain, one taste ganglia. neurons
innervate tongue oral cavity. - sit approximately? - Around
there. - Right around there. lymph nodes, less? - got it.
two main ganglia innervate vast majority taste buds oral cavity.
sweet signal goes onto brain stem. brain stem
entry body brain. different areas brain stem.
different groups neurons brain stem. unique area
unique, topographically defined location rostral side brain receives
taste input. - dense area brain. - rich area brain.
Exactly. there, sweet signal goes area higher brain
stem. goes number stations sweet signal goes
sweet neuron sweet neuron, sweet neuron, eventually get cortex.


gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial

even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad

taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across

like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,

million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,

clearly plastic, mega plastic, fundamental basis neural

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving

big issue, can really a,

01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes Behavior

02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context



- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,

gets taste cortex, meaning imposed signal.
then, data suggests now can identify
sweet stimuli. - [Andrew] quickly happen? - know, time
scale nervous system fast. - within less second. - [Charles] Yeah,
absolutely. - rarely mistake bitter sweet. Maybe respect people
poor judgment, not respect taste. - fact, can demonstrate
can stick electrodes stations, conceptually, can
stimulate tongue, can record signals pretty much time log
stimulus delivery. deliver stimuli within fraction second, see now
response following stations, now gets cortex, now
impose meaning taste. area brain represents taste
sweet taste cortex different area represents taste bitter. sense,
topographic map taste qualities inside brain. Now going
thought experiment. Now, group neurons cortex really represents
sense sweet added different group neurons brain represents
taste, perception bitter, able two things. First,
able go brain, somehow silence neurons, find way prevent
activated. can give sweet want, never
know tasting sweet. conversely, able go brain,
come way activate neurons giving absolutely nothing.
going think getting full percept precisely
done. precisely get. course brain mice. -
presumably humans work similarly. - Absolutely same, zero doubt.
no questions. attests two important things, first predetermined
nature sense taste, means can go parts brain
absence stimuli. throw full behavioral experience. fact,
activate cortex, bitter neurons, animal can start gagging,
drinking water, animal thinks getting bitter stimuli. [audience
applauds] amazing. - so, second, just finish line
doesn't sound like teaches two things give one lesson.
substantiates capacity brain segregate, separate nodes action,
representation

00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior



two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion

- precisely see. - [Charles] precisely see. - Many
people, including myself, familiar experience going restaurant, eating
variety foods. fortunately doesn't happen often, feeling
sick. learned coming neuroscience one strong example one trial
learning, point on, not restaurant waitress waiter,
date, notion shrimp leads want
avoid shrimp every context, maybe even shrimp powder. - got it. - long
time. can imagine evolutionarily adaptive reasons phenomenon
exist. concept pathway exists? - do,
know actually significant amount general level. fact, shrimp, oysters
even dramatic example, one bad oyster need driven way
next six months. - think texture alone something one learns
overcome. actually really enjoy oysters. despise mussels, despise shrimp, not
animal, taste yet oysters, reason, yet bad
experience. - like, uni, way texture hard get over, get over,
delicious. - tell me. San Diego one point,
give plug Sushi Ota, kind famous place, amazing uni
tried twice. oh two. somehow texture outweighs kind
deliciousness people report. - acquired taste. like beer, grew
Chile, accent comes case anyone wonder. time
came graduate school, 19, old overcome heavy Chilian accent.
am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite 40 plus- - appreciate it. - still
sound like just came off boat. Chile, don't drink beer young,
drink wine. Chili's huge wine producer. came US,


classmates drinking beer finished college
drinking graduate school, working 18 hours day every day, way
relax, go beers. - beer cheaper. - beer cheap,
clearly underpaid may add. couldn't it. acquired taste.
late then. 60 plus. take beer drank
entire life, say add less eight ounce glass water. - Impressive.
Well, health probably better it. - not sure. - physical health anyway. -
goes back acquired taste. connection uni oysters. Now,
going back one trial learning great thing brains, certain things
need repeat hundred times learn them, hello operator. Can phone
number sushi Ota, please? give phone, least
old days. need repeat over,
next minute. can dial sushi Ota, five minutes later, gone.
call working memory. short term memory. park car.
lucky, end day, remember is. long term
memory. remember birthdays every one children rest
lives. Well, events single event traumatic activates
circuits way one trial learning. taste system literally top
food chain. phenomenon known conditioned taste aversion.
can pair attractive stimuli really bad one, can make animal begin
vehemently dislike example, sugar. conditioned
animals now averse otherwise nice taste associated
malaise. that, now begin ask change

now transformed sweet attractive immersive.
way now begin explore

01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes One’s Lifetime

brain changes, nature, quality, meaning stimuli function

element kind mystery it. start think
nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,
sensitivity, et cetera, can explain transition wanting avoid vegetables,
willing eat vegetables simply childhood early development. Yes, going
take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food
coming. Now, first incredible finding made fact dog now
presence bell alone will start salivate. will call neurologically
speaking anticipatory response. Okay, understand it. get it. know,
neurons brain form association now represent food coming.
sending signal motor neurons go salivary glands squeeze them.
release saliva know food coming, even remarkable
animals also releasing insulin response bell. Okay.
illustrates one part two-way highway, highway going down, somehow
brain created associations neurons brain now no food

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective

brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose
gut cells susceptible things healthier us. - good. Excellent
idea. think important goal will come strategy identify

one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

two diametrically opposed percepts. sweet, example, versus bitter. -
reason say amazing, also amazing following, told us earlier,
absolutely correct, course, end day, whether not one group
neurons here, another group neurons there, way turns
be, electrical activity generic, common language sets neurons.
raises question me, whether not separate sets neurons
connected areas brain create sense valence whether not
simply created connected, excuse me, sets neurons evoke distinct
behaviors moving towards inhaling licking aversive
essentially interpreting behavior micro responses micro responses
behaviors consequence percept? - Excellent, excellent question.
first answer go area brain valence imposed, area
known amygdala sweet neurons go different area bitter
neurons. Now want thought experiment think audience might
appreciate this. say activate group neurons animal increases
licking activating sweet neurons. expected now
tasting water sugar. Now Moses transforming water wine
case going to, today's Passover, appropriate example,
transforming sweet. know activating evoking positive
feeling inside, goodness, satisfaction, love versus just increasing licking,
option, seeing animal leaking more.
trying infer means feeling something really good versus
know what, piano line going back straight tongue.
forcing move faster. Well, can actually separate experiments
allows fundamentally distinguish imagine following experiment, going
take animal going put inside box two sides. two
sides features make different. One yellow little toys. one
green toys. One little black stripes. one blue stripes.
animal can tell two halves, take mouse, put inside arena, play
arena. will explore potter around sides equal frequency. now
going going activate neurons, sweet neurons, every
time animal side yellow stripes. creating positive
internal state, animal now want do? will want stay side


yellow stripes. no licking here. animal not extending tongue every
time activating neurons. known place preference test.
generally used, just one form many different tests demonstrate
activation group neurons brain imposing, example, positive versus
negative valance. Whereas thing activating bitter neurons,
animal will actively want now stay away side neurons
activated.

taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit

million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb

go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule

understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means

one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful

nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across

like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,

million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution
infinite wisdom, evolved system put together pathway cortex,

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,

want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context



- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories
food grew Chile. meat always been, eat seldom now. -
right? - Yeah, know not necessarily healthiest thing, red meat
talking about. grew eating every day. talking seven days week, Chile,
Argentina, mainstay diet. Now maybe red meat. don't know,

taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit

sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high

- arbiter, ultimately arbiter many pathways. - final question.
one simply entertain curiosity curiosity listeners.
absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,
made 11 components going mix potpourri greens
things here. one, going present beautiful
arrangement. going put behind glass cabinet going sell
them. going sell one $2 one $8, precisely ingredient.
Exactly amount each. Ultimately going mix them, going
same, people will pay $8 know what, evokes different
person. gives feel that, oh goodness, going enjoy salad.
going back to, favorite food, eating really sensory journey. don't
mean every day, let chicken wings, hungry it, eh,
every piece think important evoking sensory role. terms categories

nuance like live edge, say, many different tastes
taste dial go back analogy earlier, color dial, think
something fixed bitter, instance, don't think like bitter taste, like
fermented foods seem little bit sour little bit
briny flavor. much plasticity think particular across
lifespan, think one salient examples kids don't seem
like certain vegetables, hardwired like sweet tastes. yet
also imagine one reasons may eventually grow incorporate
vegetables knowledge vegetables might be- - Good you. -
Better them. change receptors, distribution, number,

take question slightly differently, think illustrate point. want
just use difference olfactory system taste system make
point, taste system five basic pallets, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,
predetermined identity. know exactly valence. attractive.
aversive. olfactory system, claimed can smell millions different
odors, yet part, none innate predetermined meaning,
olfactory system, meaning imposed learning experience. - Even smell
smoke? - going give you, going make differently. handful
millions odors claimed that, immediately tell

assure cultures societies things far less appealing
vomit not evoke adverse reaction. - Really? - Really, sulfur maybe
universal. not talking pheromones. pheromones different category
trigger innate responses, nearly every afforded meaning learning
experience. like broccoli. despise broccoli remember
mother forcing eat broccoli. [audience applauds] sorry. - sensory

five classes. not going take lot brain. can, fact, smell


million others, everyone else others predetermined, meaning
not going enough brain just accommodate one sense. evolution

got odor alone, go right push lever mice. get taste alone, go
part push lever. get two together, something
else. train mice, mice able now report back
sensing taste alone, odor alone, mix. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - Now can
go brain mice go area now uncover, discover
side multisensory integration taste odor, silence it, prevent
activated experimentally. area really represented integration
two, animals still able recognize taste alone. still
able recognize alone, incapable now recognize mix,
exactly predicted. exactly get. right? - brain basically

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work

absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

absolute favorite food? - Oh, goodness. - Taste, say. Taste
distinguish taste nutritive value lack thereof. - Look, we, unlike every
animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used

don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb

Remember Pavlov? Pavlov classical experiments conditioning, associative
conditioning, take bell, ring bell every time going feed
dog. eventually dog learned associate ringing bell food

presence bell alone will start salivate. will call neurologically
speaking anticipatory response. Okay, understand it. get it. know,
neurons brain form association now represent food coming.
sending signal motor neurons go salivary glands squeeze them.
release saliva know food coming, even remarkable
animals also releasing insulin response bell. Okay.

- Please, please. No, mean, vagus nerve popular culture kind
converted single meaning calming pathways, mostly actually
tip hat yogic community among first talk vagus
on, calming pathways, so-called parasympathetic pathways within
vagus. think learn vagus, seems like

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose
gut cells susceptible things healthier us. - good. Excellent
idea. think important goal will come strategy identify
means allow us modulate circuits way certainly those,
big issue, can really a,

01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes Behavior

know, dramatic impact improving human health. - wrong this.
happy wrong. often wrong. told wrong, cells

gut sense amino acids fatty acids. imagine scenario one

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective

didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega

animal every animal species eat enjoyment it, doesn't happen wild,
animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled

different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb

animals eat need eat. Doesn't mean don't enjoy it,
completely different story. many favorite foods enjoy sensory
experience rather food whole thing, presentation,
look, there've experiments done psycho physics, going take salad,

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental

01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis

brain tell pancreas release right amount insulin?
So, let tell gut brain axis insatiable appetite sugar fat.
Insatiable sugar, unquenchable fat. story fundamental
difference liking wanting. Liking sugar function taste system.
not really liking sugar, liking sweet, wanting sugar, never ending appetite
sugar story gut brain axis, liking versus wanting. work work
laboratory. know, began long ago discovered sweet
receptors can now engineer mice lack receptors. essence,
animals will unable taste sweet, life without sweetness. horrible.
give normal mouse, bottle containing sweet, going put either
sugar artificial sweetener, bottle sweet. slightly different tastes,
simply artificial sweeteners off tastes. far sweet
receptor concerned, activate receptor, trigger signal.
give animal, option bottle containing sugar sweetener versus
water, animal will drink 10 one bottle containing sweet. taste
system, animal goes samples, one, licks couple licks says,
one want appetitive. love it. - prefers sugar artificial
sweetener? - No, no, no, no, no, no. experiment, experiment, going put
sweet one bottle either sugar artificial sweetener. doesn't
matter one. going next experiment separate two,
now sweet versus water. sweet means sweet, not sugar. Sweet means
anything tastes sweet. sugar one example Splenda another example. -
Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. - mean, humans
can taste. Mice cannot taste receptors humans mice
different, put human receptor mice. engineer mice
completely humanize mouse's taste world. purpose conversation,
comparing sweet versus water, option. goodness, will lick know
sweet side 10 one, least versus water, makes sense? right,
now going take mice going genetically engineer remove
sweet receptors. mice no longer oral cavity, sensors
can detect sweetness, sugar molecule artificial sweetener, anything


else tastes sweet. give mice option sweet versus water,
sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, will drink equally well
cannot tell apart doesn't receptors sweet.
sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - good. Now
going experiment sugar now focus sugar.
going give mouse sugar versus water. Normal mouse will drink sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar, little water, knock sweet receptors, eliminate
them. Mouse can no longer tell apart. will drink both. keep
mouse case next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
come 48 hours later. see mouse licking drinking from, mouse
drinking almost exclusively sugar bottle. be? cannot not taste
it. doesn't sweet receptors 48 hours mouse learn
something bottle makes feel good. bottle want
consume. Now mouse identify bottle? using sensory
features, smell bottle, texture solution inside, sugar, high
concentrations kind goopy, side bottle cage. doesn't
matter what, mouse realize something makes feel good.
want. fundamental basis unquenchable desire
craving sugar mediated gut brain axis. first clue
takes long time develop, immediately suggesting post-ingestive effect.
reason true gut brain axis driving sugar preference.
group neurons brain responding post-ingestive sugar,
low behold, identify group neurons brain
neurons receive input directly gut brain axis. - neurons. -
got it. happening sugar recognized normally tongue,
activates appetitive response. Now ingest now activates selective
group cells intestines now send signal brain via vagal ganglia
says, got need. tongue doesn't know got need.
knows tasted it. knows got point going used,
gut. now sends signal now reinforce consumption
thing, one needed. Sugar, source energy. -
neurons gut? - not neurons gut. gut cells
recognize sugar molecule. - [Andrew] see. - Send signal signal
received vagal neuron directly. - Got it. - sends signal gut


brain axis cell bodies neurons vagal ganglia,
brain stem now trigger preference sugar. - Two questions. One, mentioned
cells detect sugar within gut actually within intestine.
didn't say stomach. surprised me. always think gut stomach, course- -
intestines, absorption happens. - [Andrew] Got it. -
want signal, see, want brain know successful
ingestion breakdown whatever consume building blocks life,
glucose, amino acids, fat. want make sure form

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work
tongue. liking recognize sweet versus non-sweet, fail activate key
sensors gut now inform brain

01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis

got sugar, no need crave anymore. - issue wanting, can relate
particular set neurochemicals upstream, pathway is, glucose
activating cells gut vagus communicated
presumably nodus ganglia brain stem. - good, there,
go? - Yeah, go, substrate wanting?


course think molecules like dopamine craving, book even called molecule
more, et cetera. Dopamine diabolical molecule, know,
evokes sense pleasure-ish, also sense desiring more, craving.
understand correctly, artificial sweeteners are, agree failing means
satisfy sugar craving level nutrient sensing. yet trigger true
sugar evoked wanting pathway much, experienced this, eat
sugar find wanting sugar. Now also
insulin dysregulation, can uncouple those? - mean, look, mega
problem consumption sugar fat, facing unique time
evolution diseases malnutrition due over-nutrition. mean, nuts
that? Historically, diseases malnutrition always linked undernutrition.
need come strategies can meaningfully change activation
circuits control wanting certainly populations risk, gut
brain circuit ultimately lines communication informing brain,
presence intestinal sugar, example, important target way
think about, way can meaningfully modulate circuits?
make brain think got satisfied sugar, even though not giving
sugar. - immediately raises question receptors glucose
gut cells susceptible things healthier us. - good. Excellent
idea. think important goal will come strategy identify
means allow us modulate circuits way certainly those,
big issue, can really a,

01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes Behavior

happy wrong. often wrong. told wrong, cells
within gut don't just sense sugar, glucose specific, also cells within
gut sense amino acids fatty acids. imagine scenario one

01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite

intestines can now absorb them, get signal back saying
want. Now let just take one step further. now sugar molecules activates
unique gut brain circuit now drives development preference sugar.
Now, key element circuit sensors gut recognize sugar
not recognize artificial sweeteners all. - nutrient value uncoupled
taste? - Generically speaking one can make that,
different type receptor. Turns not tongue receptors used
gut. completely different molecule recognizes glucose molecule, not
artificial sweeteners. profound impact effect ultimately artificial
sweeteners curbing appetite, craving, insatiable desire sugar, since
don't activate gut brain axis, never satisfy craving sugar like sugar
does. reason believe artificial sweeteners failed market curb
appetite. need, desire sugar beautifully work

sensors gut now inform brain
