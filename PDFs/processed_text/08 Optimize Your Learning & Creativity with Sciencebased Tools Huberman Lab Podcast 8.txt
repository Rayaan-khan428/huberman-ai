talk neuroplasticity. specifically, talk how, can optimize
brains. Neuroplasticity incredible feature nervous system allows
change itself, even ways consciously decide. incredible property.
liver can't decide just change itself. spleen can't decide just change itself,
conscious thought, feedback another person. cells
tissues can make changes sure, nervous system, harbors incredible
ability direct changes, ways believe, told will serve us
better. Now, today's really special episode because, going talk
science always will delve mechanism. Today's episode really geared
toward answering common questions leverage neuroplasticity.
previous episodes focus, achieve focus sake plasticity.
well last episode is, portals plasticity
relate movement, behavior can activate plasticity, well activate
plasticity behavior itself. get better learning certain movements. Today's
podcast really directed toward answering common questions,
bigger theme, one go optimizing brain even think about,
optimizing brain? thing calling optimizing brain?
also gonna share my, typical routines tools. don't share


think ones available there. Certainly
not. share think everyone just 'cause
them, certainly not. share many you, asked concrete
examples when, share can decide
whether not protocols not. Everybody's different,
common features, put together, level nervous
system body, direct us toward particular practices, particular routines

07:13 Plasticity NOT Goal

can especially powerful, neuroplasticity. wanna open discussion
today, emphasizing something, fundamentally important.
plasticity, not goal. Plasticity never goal. Plasticity simply state,
capacity, nervous system change. so, nothing makes frustrated,
perhaps hear, oh, know, pill, potion, practice, gives
plasticity. Plasticity just change. real question trying change?
specifically end goal trying achieve? Specific end goals might
extremely specific. Like, want learn speak particular language
want learn new motor skill want get good calculus, like
forget bad emotions related particular human experience, can
general. Like like creative. actually talk creativity
today. like achieve focus like less stressed.
important, understand plasticity, achieving plasticity first
step, call optimizing brain. don't want brain plastic
time. fact, one major questions, one major unsolved mysteries
neuroscience every one us wakes every day, knows
are. be? Well, brain plastic. capacity change
throughout lifespan not plastic, every night go sleep,
waking connections get reconfigured much forget are,
walk, eat. good thing don't have, robust plasticity
ongoing plasticity, restructure day. part
gives life continuity. remember, plasticity not never goal. goal
figure access plasticity, direct plasticity, toward particular
goals changes like achieve. just mention,



09:26 No Obligation Change

no rule life leverage incredible thing called neuro-
plasticity. No one said that. podcast episode particularly
people, either happy unhappy particular aspect
life. wanna shift it, positive way. many listening might
say, well wouldn't everyone wanna that? Well actually, certain number
people pretty good don't wanna change
terrific. tip hat think wonderful. ever decide

09:59 Practical Plasticity Language

wanna leverage plasticity mechanisms, can, stage
throughout lifespan. start talking different systems within
nervous system, available plasticity. so, frame
context daily basis, weekly basis, yearly basis. First
all, several forms plasticity. names like long-term potentiation,
long-term depression, nothing emotional depression, way.
things like spike-timing-dependent plasticity. names used describe
cellular phenomenon. actual ways synapses, connections
neurons change. mention things give little [indistinct]
mentioned them. But, probably not best way think plasticity
terms optimizing brain. best way think terms short term,
medium term, long-term plasticity. Short-term plasticity, kind shift
want achieve, moment day, don't necessarily wanna hold
forever. might say, well, kinds things those? Well, instance,
short-term plasticity might be, wake earlier like catch flight.
not feeling particularly alert, want use protocol, decide use
protocol coffee certain form breathing
tool, become alert time day normally aren't
alert. But, expectation return home, will discard that,
need 5:30 asleep 5:30 AM. short-term
plasticity, behavioral plasticity. medium-term plasticity changes,


might wanna make. call respect, little bit humor, least
kinda humor. call undergraduate, pre-med phenomenon.
worked pre-meds. tremendous respect medical students
pre-meds, kind stereotype don't necessarily agree with,
stereotype wanna know need know sake exam,
don't really wanna know. just want A. don't think always
true. worked number different pre-meds years many
absolutely, passionate knowledge itself. also wanted
A. pre-med phenomenon discussed among professors TAs,
that, know, got students, just wanna know need know
can get A, right? medium-term plasticity. don't actually want
embedded memory long, else actually care
information. medium term information. sometimes useful instance
go vacation Costa Rica, don't know way around Costa Rica.
wanna learn different town routes there. don't
intention going back. just medium term. wanna just program sake
time wanna discard it. time think
talk optimizing brain, talking long-term plasticity. talking
kinds changes people wanna make brain reflexively works
differently. child goes not knowing walk
knowing walk. doesn't think learns walk.
becomes reflexive. Long-term plasticity, almost always big goal. wanna know
speak language. wanna able skill. wanna able feel
way, without put much work it. tools protocols one
can achieve that. going talk those.

13:37 Pillars Neuroplasticity

talked previous episodes will revisit protocols
today. gonna frame context daily life, weekly life,
yearly life. because, neuroplasticity optimizing brain, rides
deeper foundation, thing governs plasticity. fact, governs life, called
autonomic arousal asleep part 24 hour cycle
awake almost always. push stay awake, okay. can


night two, almost always asleep portion awake
portion it. said say again. trigger plasticity
learning occurs high focus, high alertness states, not asleep.
focus alertness key neurochemicals associated
states. But, actual rewiring reconfiguration brain connections happens
non sleep deep rest, talk always. And, deep sleep.
trigger change sleep get change. So, things
talk today optimizing brain, centered around not sleep, around
autonomic arousal system. system neurons brain body
just incredible, wake us make us alert. not accessing
system, well, cannot access plasticity. can not optimize brain. Likewise,
cannot sleep well, can't rest well, will not access plasticity rewire
brain

15:16 Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

actual configuration connections occurs. set
context, wake day, totally honest. usually don't feel like
bouncing right bed. usually don't feel completely rested. not
don't get enough sleep. probably not terrific timing sleep
well. Now month isn't sleep, previous month really wanna
emphasize points. wake up, generally tired, groggy like,
tend go sleep late. just thing do. tend get
early either set alarm, things do, naturally
wake early light coming forth. Well, tells
probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. may heard
chronotypes. genetically programmed things. chronotype, shorter
24 hours. means cycle waking alertness probably shorter
24 hours. means getting light late afternoon will help shift,
make cycle little bit longer. will phase delay doesn't make
sense, see previous episode. really means getting light
afternoon, will allow stay little bit later. means that, not really
matching hard-wired needs going bed probably 8:30 9:00 waking
4:00 AM. tend go sleep around 10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 12:00


wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock,
plastic throughout lifespan. massive configuration connections there.
cell type called astrocytes glial cell, actively removing
reinforcing connections eye clock, every day. Now incredible
aspects brain instance, represent knowing
are, wake morning, name is, assuming old
enough already learned name. first things kids learn
something rarely ever forget. connections, changing time every 24
hour cycle. opportunity short-term plasticity. view
sunlight first thing day, helps wake up. thing
circuit, exists circadian clock adrenals talked
triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal
axis, subject plasticity also. delaying caffeine two hours
waking, able capture, reinforce, potentiate, neural circuit exists
circadian clock cortisol released adrenals, well as, leave
adenosine receptors, unoccupied can use caffeine get
natural lift, alertness focus two hours later opposed using it, just wake
sleepiness. sure eye-rolls
yawns, about, oh no, sunlight morning thing again. powerful
tool, readjusting circuits. short-term plasticity. reason
delaying caffeine first two hours day even painful first
couple days naturally start wake up, readily morning
without caffeine because, adenosine suppressed don't
competing. called competing antagonist,

21:19 Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

adenosine receptor. wake up, get sunlight eyes. Lately
wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

think ones available there. Certainly
not. share think everyone just 'cause
them, certainly not. share many you, asked concrete
examples when, share can decide
whether not protocols not. Everybody's different,
common features, put together, level nervous
system body, direct us toward particular practices, particular routines

07:13 Plasticity NOT Goal

can especially powerful, neuroplasticity. wanna open discussion
today, emphasizing something, fundamentally important.
plasticity, not goal. Plasticity never goal. Plasticity simply state,
capacity, nervous system change. so, nothing makes frustrated,
perhaps hear, oh, know, pill, potion, practice, gives
plasticity. Plasticity just change. real question trying change?
specifically end goal trying achieve? Specific end goals might
extremely specific. Like, want learn speak particular language
want learn new motor skill want get good calculus, like
forget bad emotions related particular human experience, can
general. Like like creative. actually talk creativity
today. like achieve focus like less stressed.
important, understand plasticity, achieving plasticity first
step, call optimizing brain. don't want brain plastic
time. fact, one major questions, one major unsolved mysteries
neuroscience every one us wakes every day, knows
are. be? Well, brain plastic. capacity change
throughout lifespan not plastic, every night go sleep,
waking connections get reconfigured much forget are,
walk, eat. good thing don't have, robust plasticity
ongoing plasticity, restructure day. part
gives life continuity. remember, plasticity not never goal. goal
figure access plasticity, direct plasticity, toward particular
goals changes like achieve. just mention,



09:26 No Obligation Change

no rule life leverage incredible thing called neuro-
plasticity. No one said that. podcast episode particularly
people, either happy unhappy particular aspect
life. wanna shift it, positive way. many listening might
say, well wouldn't everyone wanna that? Well actually, certain number
people pretty good don't wanna change
terrific. tip hat think wonderful. ever decide

09:59 Practical Plasticity Language

wanna leverage plasticity mechanisms, can, stage
throughout lifespan. start talking different systems within
nervous system, available plasticity. so, frame
context daily basis, weekly basis, yearly basis. First
all, several forms plasticity. names like long-term potentiation,
long-term depression, nothing emotional depression, way.
things like spike-timing-dependent plasticity. names used describe
cellular phenomenon. actual ways synapses, connections
neurons change. mention things give little [indistinct]
mentioned them. But, probably not best way think plasticity
terms optimizing brain. best way think terms short term,
medium term, long-term plasticity. Short-term plasticity, kind shift
want achieve, moment day, don't necessarily wanna hold
forever. might say, well, kinds things those? Well, instance,
short-term plasticity might be, wake earlier like catch flight.
not feeling particularly alert, want use protocol, decide use
protocol coffee certain form breathing
tool, become alert time day normally aren't
alert. But, expectation return home, will discard that,
need 5:30 asleep 5:30 AM. short-term
plasticity, behavioral plasticity. medium-term plasticity changes,


might wanna make. call respect, little bit humor, least
kinda humor. call undergraduate, pre-med phenomenon.
worked pre-meds. tremendous respect medical students
pre-meds, kind stereotype don't necessarily agree with,
stereotype wanna know need know sake exam,
don't really wanna know. just want A. don't think always
true. worked number different pre-meds years many
absolutely, passionate knowledge itself. also wanted
A. pre-med phenomenon discussed among professors TAs,
that, know, got students, just wanna know need know
can get A, right? medium-term plasticity. don't actually want
embedded memory long, else actually care
information. medium term information. sometimes useful instance
go vacation Costa Rica, don't know way around Costa Rica.
wanna learn different town routes there. don't
intention going back. just medium term. wanna just program sake
time wanna discard it. time think
talk optimizing brain, talking long-term plasticity. talking
kinds changes people wanna make brain reflexively works
differently. child goes not knowing walk
knowing walk. doesn't think learns walk.
becomes reflexive. Long-term plasticity, almost always big goal. wanna know
speak language. wanna able skill. wanna able feel
way, without put much work it. tools protocols one
can achieve that. going talk those.

13:37 Pillars Neuroplasticity

talked previous episodes will revisit protocols
today. gonna frame context daily life, weekly life,
yearly life. because, neuroplasticity optimizing brain, rides
deeper foundation, thing governs plasticity. fact, governs life, called
autonomic arousal asleep part 24 hour cycle
awake almost always. push stay awake, okay. can


night two, almost always asleep portion awake
portion it. said say again. trigger plasticity
learning occurs high focus, high alertness states, not asleep.
focus alertness key neurochemicals associated
states. But, actual rewiring reconfiguration brain connections happens
non sleep deep rest, talk always. And, deep sleep.
trigger change sleep get change. So, things
talk today optimizing brain, centered around not sleep, around
autonomic arousal system. system neurons brain body
just incredible, wake us make us alert. not accessing
system, well, cannot access plasticity. can not optimize brain. Likewise,
cannot sleep well, can't rest well, will not access plasticity rewire
brain

15:16 Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

actual configuration connections occurs. set
context, wake day, totally honest. usually don't feel like
bouncing right bed. usually don't feel completely rested. not
don't get enough sleep. probably not terrific timing sleep
well. Now month isn't sleep, previous month really wanna
emphasize points. wake up, generally tired, groggy like,
tend go sleep late. just thing do. tend get
early either set alarm, things do, naturally
wake early light coming forth. Well, tells
probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. may heard
chronotypes. genetically programmed things. chronotype, shorter
24 hours. means cycle waking alertness probably shorter
24 hours. means getting light late afternoon will help shift,
make cycle little bit longer. will phase delay doesn't make
sense, see previous episode. really means getting light
afternoon, will allow stay little bit later. means that, not really
matching hard-wired needs going bed probably 8:30 9:00 waking
4:00 AM. tend go sleep around 10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 12:00


wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock,
plastic throughout lifespan. massive configuration connections there.
cell type called astrocytes glial cell, actively removing
reinforcing connections eye clock, every day. Now incredible
aspects brain instance, represent knowing
are, wake morning, name is, assuming old
enough already learned name. first things kids learn
something rarely ever forget. connections, changing time every 24
hour cycle. opportunity short-term plasticity. view
sunlight first thing day, helps wake up. thing
circuit, exists circadian clock adrenals talked
triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal
axis, subject plasticity also. delaying caffeine two hours
waking, able capture, reinforce, potentiate, neural circuit exists
circadian clock cortisol released adrenals, well as, leave
adenosine receptors, unoccupied can use caffeine get
natural lift, alertness focus two hours later opposed using it, just wake
sleepiness. sure eye-rolls
yawns, about, oh no, sunlight morning thing again. powerful
tool, readjusting circuits. short-term plasticity. reason
delaying caffeine first two hours day even painful first
couple days naturally start wake up, readily morning
without caffeine because, adenosine suppressed don't
competing. called competing antagonist,

21:19 Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

adenosine receptor. wake up, get sunlight eyes. Lately
wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

09:26 No Obligation Change

no rule life leverage incredible thing called neuro-
plasticity. No one said that. podcast episode particularly
people, either happy unhappy particular aspect
life. wanna shift it, positive way. many listening might
say, well wouldn't everyone wanna that? Well actually, certain number
people pretty good don't wanna change
terrific. tip hat think wonderful. ever decide

09:59 Practical Plasticity Language

wanna leverage plasticity mechanisms, can, stage
throughout lifespan. start talking different systems within
nervous system, available plasticity. so, frame
context daily basis, weekly basis, yearly basis. First
all, several forms plasticity. names like long-term potentiation,
long-term depression, nothing emotional depression, way.
things like spike-timing-dependent plasticity. names used describe
cellular phenomenon. actual ways synapses, connections
neurons change. mention things give little [indistinct]
mentioned them. But, probably not best way think plasticity
terms optimizing brain. best way think terms short term,
medium term, long-term plasticity. Short-term plasticity, kind shift
want achieve, moment day, don't necessarily wanna hold
forever. might say, well, kinds things those? Well, instance,
short-term plasticity might be, wake earlier like catch flight.
not feeling particularly alert, want use protocol, decide use
protocol coffee certain form breathing
tool, become alert time day normally aren't
alert. But, expectation return home, will discard that,
need 5:30 asleep 5:30 AM. short-term
plasticity, behavioral plasticity. medium-term plasticity changes,


might wanna make. call respect, little bit humor, least
kinda humor. call undergraduate, pre-med phenomenon.
worked pre-meds. tremendous respect medical students
pre-meds, kind stereotype don't necessarily agree with,
stereotype wanna know need know sake exam,
don't really wanna know. just want A. don't think always
true. worked number different pre-meds years many
absolutely, passionate knowledge itself. also wanted
A. pre-med phenomenon discussed among professors TAs,
that, know, got students, just wanna know need know
can get A, right? medium-term plasticity. don't actually want
embedded memory long, else actually care
information. medium term information. sometimes useful instance
go vacation Costa Rica, don't know way around Costa Rica.
wanna learn different town routes there. don't
intention going back. just medium term. wanna just program sake
time wanna discard it. time think
talk optimizing brain, talking long-term plasticity. talking
kinds changes people wanna make brain reflexively works
differently. child goes not knowing walk
knowing walk. doesn't think learns walk.
becomes reflexive. Long-term plasticity, almost always big goal. wanna know
speak language. wanna able skill. wanna able feel
way, without put much work it. tools protocols one
can achieve that. going talk those.

13:37 Pillars Neuroplasticity

talked previous episodes will revisit protocols
today. gonna frame context daily life, weekly life,
yearly life. because, neuroplasticity optimizing brain, rides
deeper foundation, thing governs plasticity. fact, governs life, called
autonomic arousal asleep part 24 hour cycle
awake almost always. push stay awake, okay. can


night two, almost always asleep portion awake
portion it. said say again. trigger plasticity
learning occurs high focus, high alertness states, not asleep.
focus alertness key neurochemicals associated
states. But, actual rewiring reconfiguration brain connections happens
non sleep deep rest, talk always. And, deep sleep.
trigger change sleep get change. So, things
talk today optimizing brain, centered around not sleep, around
autonomic arousal system. system neurons brain body
just incredible, wake us make us alert. not accessing
system, well, cannot access plasticity. can not optimize brain. Likewise,
cannot sleep well, can't rest well, will not access plasticity rewire
brain

15:16 Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

actual configuration connections occurs. set
context, wake day, totally honest. usually don't feel like
bouncing right bed. usually don't feel completely rested. not
don't get enough sleep. probably not terrific timing sleep
well. Now month isn't sleep, previous month really wanna
emphasize points. wake up, generally tired, groggy like,
tend go sleep late. just thing do. tend get
early either set alarm, things do, naturally
wake early light coming forth. Well, tells
probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. may heard
chronotypes. genetically programmed things. chronotype, shorter
24 hours. means cycle waking alertness probably shorter
24 hours. means getting light late afternoon will help shift,
make cycle little bit longer. will phase delay doesn't make
sense, see previous episode. really means getting light
afternoon, will allow stay little bit later. means that, not really
matching hard-wired needs going bed probably 8:30 9:00 waking
4:00 AM. tend go sleep around 10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 12:00


wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock,
plastic throughout lifespan. massive configuration connections there.
cell type called astrocytes glial cell, actively removing
reinforcing connections eye clock, every day. Now incredible
aspects brain instance, represent knowing
are, wake morning, name is, assuming old
enough already learned name. first things kids learn
something rarely ever forget. connections, changing time every 24
hour cycle. opportunity short-term plasticity. view
sunlight first thing day, helps wake up. thing
circuit, exists circadian clock adrenals talked
triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal
axis, subject plasticity also. delaying caffeine two hours
waking, able capture, reinforce, potentiate, neural circuit exists
circadian clock cortisol released adrenals, well as, leave
adenosine receptors, unoccupied can use caffeine get
natural lift, alertness focus two hours later opposed using it, just wake
sleepiness. sure eye-rolls
yawns, about, oh no, sunlight morning thing again. powerful
tool, readjusting circuits. short-term plasticity. reason
delaying caffeine first two hours day even painful first
couple days naturally start wake up, readily morning
without caffeine because, adenosine suppressed don't
competing. called competing antagonist,

21:19 Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

adenosine receptor. wake up, get sunlight eyes. Lately
wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

patreon.com/andrewhuberman. Finally, previous episodes today, future
episodes, mentioned supplements. Supplements one way, certainly not
way, one way can modulate, nervous system, sake
better sleep, learning, alertness, several things well. interested
supplements, partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne
supplements high stringency terms of, bottle, amounts
substances capsule pill, et cetera. And, partnered

wanna thank time attention today. always, thank
interest science.


might wanna make. call respect, little bit humor, least
kinda humor. call undergraduate, pre-med phenomenon.
worked pre-meds. tremendous respect medical students
pre-meds, kind stereotype don't necessarily agree with,
stereotype wanna know need know sake exam,
don't really wanna know. just want A. don't think always
true. worked number different pre-meds years many
absolutely, passionate knowledge itself. also wanted
A. pre-med phenomenon discussed among professors TAs,
that, know, got students, just wanna know need know
can get A, right? medium-term plasticity. don't actually want
embedded memory long, else actually care
information. medium term information. sometimes useful instance
go vacation Costa Rica, don't know way around Costa Rica.
wanna learn different town routes there. don't
intention going back. just medium term. wanna just program sake
time wanna discard it. time think
talk optimizing brain, talking long-term plasticity. talking
kinds changes people wanna make brain reflexively works
differently. child goes not knowing walk
knowing walk. doesn't think learns walk.
becomes reflexive. Long-term plasticity, almost always big goal. wanna know
speak language. wanna able skill. wanna able feel
way, without put much work it. tools protocols one
can achieve that. going talk those.

13:37 Pillars Neuroplasticity

talked previous episodes will revisit protocols
today. gonna frame context daily life, weekly life,
yearly life. because, neuroplasticity optimizing brain, rides
deeper foundation, thing governs plasticity. fact, governs life, called
autonomic arousal asleep part 24 hour cycle
awake almost always. push stay awake, okay. can


night two, almost always asleep portion awake
portion it. said say again. trigger plasticity
learning occurs high focus, high alertness states, not asleep.
focus alertness key neurochemicals associated
states. But, actual rewiring reconfiguration brain connections happens
non sleep deep rest, talk always. And, deep sleep.
trigger change sleep get change. So, things
talk today optimizing brain, centered around not sleep, around
autonomic arousal system. system neurons brain body
just incredible, wake us make us alert. not accessing
system, well, cannot access plasticity. can not optimize brain. Likewise,
cannot sleep well, can't rest well, will not access plasticity rewire
brain

15:16 Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

actual configuration connections occurs. set
context, wake day, totally honest. usually don't feel like
bouncing right bed. usually don't feel completely rested. not
don't get enough sleep. probably not terrific timing sleep
well. Now month isn't sleep, previous month really wanna
emphasize points. wake up, generally tired, groggy like,
tend go sleep late. just thing do. tend get
early either set alarm, things do, naturally
wake early light coming forth. Well, tells
probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. may heard
chronotypes. genetically programmed things. chronotype, shorter
24 hours. means cycle waking alertness probably shorter
24 hours. means getting light late afternoon will help shift,
make cycle little bit longer. will phase delay doesn't make
sense, see previous episode. really means getting light
afternoon, will allow stay little bit later. means that, not really
matching hard-wired needs going bed probably 8:30 9:00 waking
4:00 AM. tend go sleep around 10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 12:00


wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns

triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal

delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

night two, almost always asleep portion awake
portion it. said say again. trigger plasticity
learning occurs high focus, high alertness states, not asleep.
focus alertness key neurochemicals associated
states. But, actual rewiring reconfiguration brain connections happens
non sleep deep rest, talk always. And, deep sleep.
trigger change sleep get change. So, things
talk today optimizing brain, centered around not sleep, around
autonomic arousal system. system neurons brain body
just incredible, wake us make us alert. not accessing
system, well, cannot access plasticity. can not optimize brain. Likewise,
cannot sleep well, can't rest well, will not access plasticity rewire
brain

15:16 Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

actual configuration connections occurs. set
context, wake day, totally honest. usually don't feel like
bouncing right bed. usually don't feel completely rested. not
don't get enough sleep. probably not terrific timing sleep
well. Now month isn't sleep, previous month really wanna
emphasize points. wake up, generally tired, groggy like,
tend go sleep late. just thing do. tend get
early either set alarm, things do, naturally
wake early light coming forth. Well, tells
probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. may heard
chronotypes. genetically programmed things. chronotype, shorter
24 hours. means cycle waking alertness probably shorter
24 hours. means getting light late afternoon will help shift,
make cycle little bit longer. will phase delay doesn't make
sense, see previous episode. really means getting light
afternoon, will allow stay little bit later. means that, not really
matching hard-wired needs going bed probably 8:30 9:00 waking
4:00 AM. tend go sleep around 10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 12:00


wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock,
plastic throughout lifespan. massive configuration connections there.
cell type called astrocytes glial cell, actively removing
reinforcing connections eye clock, every day. Now incredible
aspects brain instance, represent knowing
are, wake morning, name is, assuming old
enough already learned name. first things kids learn
something rarely ever forget. connections, changing time every 24
hour cycle. opportunity short-term plasticity. view
sunlight first thing day, helps wake up. thing
circuit, exists circadian clock adrenals talked
triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal
axis, subject plasticity also. delaying caffeine two hours
waking, able capture, reinforce, potentiate, neural circuit exists
circadian clock cortisol released adrenals, well as, leave
adenosine receptors, unoccupied can use caffeine get
natural lift, alertness focus two hours later opposed using it, just wake
sleepiness. sure eye-rolls
yawns, about, oh no, sunlight morning thing again. powerful
tool, readjusting circuits. short-term plasticity. reason
delaying caffeine first two hours day even painful first
couple days naturally start wake up, readily morning
without caffeine because, adenosine suppressed don't
competing. called competing antagonist,

21:19 Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

adenosine receptor. wake up, get sunlight eyes. Lately
wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

wake 6:00. course, gonna feel groggy. neuroplasticity will
allow me, optimize wakefulness something order access that.
may already anticipating say, is, oh, no
gonna tell us get sunlight eyes first 30 minutes day. gonna tell
that, gonna also tell two things not discussed before,
relate plasticity, melanopsin cells. sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

17:20 Plasticity Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

eye circadian clock. never said podcast, turns
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock,
plastic throughout lifespan. massive configuration connections there.
cell type called astrocytes glial cell, actively removing
reinforcing connections eye clock, every day. Now incredible
aspects brain instance, represent knowing
are, wake morning, name is, assuming old
enough already learned name. first things kids learn
something rarely ever forget. connections, changing time every 24
hour cycle. opportunity short-term plasticity. view
sunlight first thing day, helps wake up. thing
circuit, exists circadian clock adrenals talked
triggers release cortisol first thing morning, wakes us up.
Especially view light. groggy morning viewing light
helpful. But, interesting thing start viewing light frequently morning,
connections melanopsin cells circadian clock, become
primed potentiated say, become stronger anticipation light.
naturally start waking earlier, feeling alert. So, says
get regular light know mornings, just not
gonna feel alert, feel, especially tired. might not able access sunlight
really overcast traveling, feature. system
plastic shifted right direction. Now will shift back, short-term
plasticity two, three days.



19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine

wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

19:09 Delay Caffeine!

wanna try get sunlight exposure regular basis. thing
delay intake caffeine, first two hours awake. Now, can
painful people. But, earlier talked about, adenosine system
accumulation adenosine makes us sleepy. caffeine suppresses adenosine
makes us feel alert. know, ingest caffeine, immediately
waking, signal adrenals, release cortisol, healthy release
cortisol, suppression adenosine happens come sleep,
deep sleep suppression adenosine, ingest caffeine early,
mechanism adenosine competes receptors et cetera,
mid-morning crash. caffeine, way works caffeine
occupying adenosine receptor, natural endogenous mechanisms,
suppressing adenosine, not actually gonna action. brain adrenal
axis, subject plasticity also. delaying caffeine two hours
waking, able capture, reinforce, potentiate, neural circuit exists
circadian clock cortisol released adrenals, well as, leave
adenosine receptors, unoccupied can use caffeine get
natural lift, alertness focus two hours later opposed using it, just wake
sleepiness. sure eye-rolls
yawns, about, oh no, sunlight morning thing again. powerful
tool, readjusting circuits. short-term plasticity. reason
delaying caffeine first two hours day even painful first
couple days naturally start wake up, readily morning
without caffeine because, adenosine suppressed don't
competing. called competing antagonist,

21:19 Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

adenosine receptor. wake up, get sunlight eyes. Lately
wake early use bright light, stimulate alertness. not actually
designed purpose. just light board 900 lux.
delay caffeine. asked, not saying anyone this.
know, exactly drink? big believer black coffee. just happen


like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

like black coffee. People asked about, don't wanna name brand names
type coffee or, type coffee mixed other, kinds
things. Will increase focus? know, gonna talk today lot use
diet fasting timing foods certain kinds foods. honest, black
coffee just simple choice always worked me. also make sure hydrate first
thing morning. plenty data now showing even slight, increase
dehydration, meaning just lacking water, can make people headaches.
can provide additional photophobia migraine prone.
Bright light can trigger migraines. no surprise get headaches
migraines. dehydration, can compound, vulnerability migraine
headache. drink water, drink black coffee, drink mate just
Argentine lineage just high caffeine drink first thing morning,
delay two hours wake up. because, want circuits
eye circadian clock adrenals, functioning particular way,
later caffeine addition. adds alertness.

22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

Now discussion optimize brain. Many people wake
quickly, just naturally feel like bouncing bed. envy people. will
just fine, going learning bout taking care of, whatever need
take care of. Sometimes kind mundane tasks like email whatnot.
less rule brain functions, vis-a-vis, focus, learning
creativity. gonna discuss much future episodes. Generally states
high alertness, alert, great strategy implementation.
already know something. just simply matter plugging
correct elements correct boxes. talked duration, path
outcome, three things deliberate conscious brain trying figure
order perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. sort thing
good well rested, focused. autonomic arousal
alertness rather high level. somebody hitting alertness
phase day, early, right wake up, great time move right
things that, least research says, already know, strategy
just wanna implement strategy. fundamentally depart idea


that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

that, oh, know, hardest critical tasks throughout day.
Sometimes hardest critical tasks, tasks require creativity.
soon talk creativity, tasks related it, oftentimes come us best
brain best achieving those, states calm even slightly drowsy.
something interesting get into. me, instance, get
up, not terribly alert, first thing. try just get brain thoughts
organized. not time responding linear fashion emails
carrying calculations. comes two hours later. think many people
will relate,

25:12 Background Music/Noise: Yay Nay?

mid-morning many people tend achieve peak alertness focus.
Now, many times get question say directly related
hundreds questions got this. use, background music order
learn? have, know, construction next door? good thing bad
thing? better complete silence, et cetera? Now will vary. people
can tolerate noise within head much better others. people find
background noise, helps cancel out. simple rule
thumb one can use, least experience sometimes background
music, background noise helpful allowing focus. times,
distracting. actually governs that? Well, ask ourselves,
source, lack focus? lack focus autonomic arousal
alertness very, high. little much coffee,
thing, slept little long really stressed really activated, can't seem
focus. case, eliminating background noise, really just trying get silence,
can quiet autonomic arousal, going best learning
implementation things already know do. kind focus linear
task. Which, basically learning focus linear task just not necessarily,
performing well time. Last time talked making errors. rule
thumb, keyed up, silence quiet going helpful.

26:52 “GO” versus “NO-GO”: Basal Ganglia & Dopamine



fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

fact, keyed up, particular circuit, related basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered easily. circuit, gonna talk depth. But,
called go, no-go circuit. circuits connect forebrain, structure
brain called basal ganglia actually collection structures.
forebrain, involved rational thought thinking planning action,
always trying plan do, implement action. basal
ganglia intimately involved discussion. reciprocal loop
communication, basil ganglia cortex. basal ganglia one set
connections cortex, cortex back basal ganglia facilitates go.
facilitates action. molecule, neuromodulator dopamine, triggers
activation go. tends make us want things. tends make us bias
toward action. way dopamine binds something called D1 receptors.
Just particular type dopamine receptor. wanna know. no-
go pathway, pathway basal ganglia, cortex suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding receptor called D2 receptor. Now D1, D2
receptors, can't just consciously decide, oh, want D1 receptors D2
receptors active. think about, sorts states mind body,
facilitate go, ones facilitate no-go. Now critically important,
focused work, accessing plasticity, learning,

28:37 Leveraging GO, NO-GO

involve certain things not others. works.
apply daily basis. tend alert, first thing, mid-morning
so. generally will caffeine mid-morning. peak alertness,
early part day, occurring sometime 9:30 11:00 AM.
just me. people might experience immediately rolling bed.
might wide awake ready go. case cautious
throwing caffeine mix gonna make very, alert. three
sort levels, autonomic arousal alertness, bias us toward go, no-go,
both. relates, question gotten now hundreds times you,
comment section podcast, is, better listen music
background work learn, complete silence? answer
depends. doesn't depend randomly are, even necessarily time


day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

day, depends, overall level autonomic arousal. depends because,
autonomic arousal level alertness, biases extent which, prone
gos action, no-gos, suppress action. dopamine molecule
swimming around going buy us one responses.

30:08 Non-Specific Action

works. say, alert. Maybe got particularly good night's
sleep night before, little much coffee, gonna sit
work. thing know, always tell alert,
prone go, action, also prone to, not no-go, right? not gonna good
suppressing action. two different things. biased toward action
biased, toward suppressing action two different things, okay?
push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, alert, tendency
everything stimulus. people say, well, just take drug
will increase level epinephrine alertness? Will help learn better?
No, will make things, will also make less good
suppressing actions need suppress. alert, particularly alert
recognize state is, course 'cause everyone will different. know
me. want silence learning. want shut internet,
do. sometimes use program, believe free program called Freedom,
actually locks internet particular time. not sponsor
podcast. just happen use it. another version Freedom go
wireless thing turn off. disconnect wireless. one.
Although, many people hard time not reactivating it. trying shut
go pathway towards distraction. thing do, generally turn off
phone, put phone outside car really extreme cases throw
roof hard retrieve, can't get it. alert,
aware will bias toward action. will hard suppress non-action,

32:06 Clear, Calm, Focused: GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

nonspecific. Because, next kind level alertness,
autonomic arousal clear, calm focused kind sweet spot


between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

episodes, mentioned supplements. Supplements one way, certainly not
way, one way can modulate, nervous system, sake
better sleep, learning, alertness, several things well. interested
supplements, partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne
supplements high stringency terms of, bottle, amounts
substances capsule pill, et cetera. And, partnered

between, willingness pursue action. mode go, not always
physical action can pursuing hard bouts learning. ability
suppress also good. because, don't wanna get many
details, way dopamine competes dopamine one receptors
go pathway dopamine two receptors no-go pathway. always
kind push pull. sweet spot. sweet spot isn't flow,
sort state sudden things come naturally us. state
trying achieve optimal learning one which,
energy focus pursue, also energy focus suppress action.
basal ganglia kinda working perfect kind sing songly manner,
parallel pathway. Now, get tired round ultradian cycle
90 minutes, happens fatigue even not physical fatigue makes us
wanna go sleep, mental fatigue starts accumulate pathways
go, no-go actually, metabolically consuming. recognize
start falter, harder time engaging going going toward goal
rather. also know reflex, toward actions unrelated learning
also gonna start increasing not gonna able suppress action
activate no-go pathways.

33:48 Alert, Work Silence; Tired, Include Background Noise

sounds like mouthful, make simple you.
alert, best situation learning going silence. going complete quiet.
low arousal, tired kind sleepy, lot people find
background chatter background noise, can help elevate
level autonomic arousal. auditory system visual
system, linked part really called salience network.
always, scanning environment things. lot things
environment scan, generally level alertness goes up.
environments stark little objects them, tend
make us feel kind calm, salient network kinda shuts off. lot people
don't like that. go meditation retreat, go environment
little clutter especially city people. sudden, start feeling
really, really anxious. internal level autonomic arousal


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

wanna thank time attention today. always, thank
interest science.


really high not occupied stuff pay attention to.
salience network starts turn inward. move exteroception interoception.
not looking outside themselves, looking inside
lot noise there. So, rule thumb, tend kind high level
alertness kind anxiety, not talking clinical levels anxiety
tend to, pretty high energy, well then, definitely going benefit
learning bout, learning go well activate no-go pathway.
requires lot energy. lot distractions environment,

35:28 Temperaments Vary:

high probability gonna distracted learning. Now,
people just naturally calm. like bulldog Costello, exceedingly
calm. pretty mellow. kind clear, calm focused time.
people, actually gonna less flappable. not gonna yanked around
background noise not gonna around, know, bothered
learning studying clanging pot somebody kitchen. So,
one us generally tends ride autonomic ladder, speak,

36:01 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

different times day. people, three hours waking. three hours,
not three hours mark three hour bin tends period
alert throughout day. Except tell later unique time right
sleep

36:20 Early Morning Exercise GO Networks

also very, alert, naturally. So, morning three hours quite vital.
Now, many might ask exercise exercise. think may
mentioned previous podcast episode. But, research shows least
performance, afternoon exercise might better terms avoiding injury, et cetera.
terms rising body temperatures, matching body temperature mental
alertness, et cetera. pretty clear, exercising early day, not biases us


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

1:27:57 Familiar New Ways Support

Patreon account. asked specifically, can help support
podcast weren't interested, sponsors already engaged
sponsors. So, Patreon account. can find
patreon.com/andrewhuberman. Finally, previous episodes today, future
episodes, mentioned supplements. Supplements one way, certainly not
way, one way can modulate, nervous system, sake
better sleep, learning, alertness, several things well. interested
supplements, partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne
supplements high stringency terms of, bottle, amounts
substances capsule pill, et cetera. And, partnered
groups Mayo Clinic, major sports teams. high
rigor associated Thorne decided partner them.

wanna thank time attention today. always, thank
interest science.


towards waking earlier, also triggers release things like epinephrine
neuromodulators, lend itself, situation heightened
levels arousal mental acuity late morning even afternoon. Now,
can good wanna restrict focus learning
early part day, exercising early day set neurochemical context mill
go. tends trigger activation go pathway. like
hard time kind engaging getting action early day,
early morning exercise within hour waking, certainly no later three hours
waking, will give quote unquote energy throughout day. will make
feel biased action. won't feel lethargic. So, can kind reviewing
set now morning light thing, delay caffeine two hours
waking, generally try get exercise first hour ideally within first
three hours waking up. move focused learning bout. Now,
wrote said, exercise early day, feel crash afterwards.
exercise very, intense. depleting glycogen.

38:05 Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances eat, will start
feel crash. relates timing nutrition. just general rule thumb,
fasted states, low carbohydrate states, not talking keto diet around
clock week fasted states, low carbohydrate states lend
alertness. carbohydrates rich tryptophan, tend lend
sleepiness. course, ingesting large amounts kind food,
substance fills gut will divert blood gut. eat lot food
regardless whether not lot carbohydrate not, going generally
feel sleepy. Now, many people, including everyone use food, modulate
levels autonomic arousal. typically eating shifts us towards state calm.
fasting shifts us toward state alertness. hard-wired circuits
relate need desire find food requires action, so-called rest
digest system diverts resources energy towards digestion.
makes us feel calm. personally rely water, mate, black coffee first thing
day, order exercise get first round work. find alert,
generally will tend eat kind bring level alertness, will


continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

patreon.com/andrewhuberman. Finally, previous episodes today, future
episodes, mentioned supplements. Supplements one way, certainly not
way, one way can modulate, nervous system, sake
better sleep, learning, alertness, several things well. interested
supplements, partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne
supplements high stringency terms of, bottle, amounts
substances capsule pill, et cetera. And, partnered

continue working. Now district thing. since people asked do,
not dictating people follow exactly course even generally,

39:41 Sodium/Electrolytes

just tell do. possible drinking black coffee, mate
ingesting lot water, going dehydrate somewhat,
excretion sodium. Provided don't hypertension, salt really
good thing. lot people think low blood sugar shaky
can't think headache actually low sodium.
especially drinking lot caffeine. big believer salt. drink salt
water first thing morning drink black coffee. keeps levels
alertness really good. always thought messed blood sugar. shaky
hands didn't know going on. drink little bit coffee feel
amped up. turns sodium issue. just drank water little
bit sea salt even just typical table salt, fell rock solid terms
blood sugar. Now, again, not physician, professor don't prescribe
anything, profess lots things. don't want people diabetes blood
sugar issues go off rails. responsible health, not me.
interesting parameter think experiment with, know, provided
doctor says okay, think lot people, probably ingest much sodium
lot people might sodium deficient particular people fasting.

40:57 Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

typically eat first meal right around mid day, whether not exercised not.
food content actually quite important me. don't know is.
don't scientific mechanism eat hot food lunch, get sleepy
lunch. generally don't eat hot food lunch. might little bit soup
something like that. general, rely low carbohydrate meal. eat meat
salad variation nuts fats things like
[indistinct] content focus, protein good belief.
believe eating fruits vegetables. too. exercised hard early
day, ingest starches like oatmeal rice fruit things like that. Now,


telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

telling this? Because, 100s not 1000 people ask me, fasting good
focus? indeed fasting will increase alertness, hungry preoccupied
food can't focus well, not gonna good learning.
going good agitation. Now, just gonna mark continue march

42:01 Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

day. is, course experienced. people quite
different. But, find around 2:00 3:00 PM, start getting little groggy. little
bit sleepy. will tend shift work work requires lot duration path,
outcome, really careful analysis activation no-go pathway. Meaning trying
suppress impulse look phone answer email, things.
haven't emailed back 3:00 afternoon. way, responded
text messages, whoever there. Around early afternoon, find can
kind typical mundane tasks. Because, tasks require less cognitive load.
can done less, sequence. can answer couple email
here, maybe answer email there. don't pure linear fashion.

42:56 Hydration, NSDR, Nap

kind linear work learning work gonna take lot focus. typically
around 4:00 PM so, two things. Sometimes little earlier. Sometimes little later
two things. One, make sure hydrate. exercising
eating, need digest food, et cetera. make sure hydrate. drink
water. try refrain drinking coffee afternoon. new thing me.
sometimes it, try refrain that. always do, non sleep deep
rest protocol sometime afternoon. sometimes 10 minute yoga nidra type
protocol, 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol. protocols no
relationship to, no business relationship whatsoever. years
now. involve listening script. provide links although
provided before. hypnosis protocol, Reveri Health
colleague David Spiegel's website free hypnosis apps scripts
can listen to. take state really deep rest. Sometimes much
fall asleep. always set alarm don't sleep longer 90


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

Patreon account. asked specifically, can help support
podcast weren't interested, sponsors already engaged
sponsors. So, Patreon account. can find
patreon.com/andrewhuberman. Finally, previous episodes today, future
episodes, mentioned supplements. Supplements one way, certainly not
way, one way can modulate, nervous system, sake
better sleep, learning, alertness, several things well. interested
supplements, partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne
supplements high stringency terms of, bottle, amounts
substances capsule pill, et cetera. And, partnered

wanna thank time attention today. always, thank
interest science.


minutes. typically goes 30 minutes.
4:30 afternoon, capable basically nothing. just complete
Costello. can't think, can't do, can't respond email. just completely troughed
ability function. personally find mistake, point, double
espresso, charge really hard. just doesn't work me. end really disrupting
sleep schedule. end disrupting lot different things. me, non
sleep deep rest protocol. really helps later need fall asleep. helps
sorts things, mentioned before. usually emerge little groggy
feeling like another whole day, second wind.

44:54 Creativity Work

Like just work. second bout learning. sort work
either involves linear analysis something. maybe numerical work trying
learn something. generally try really use bouts 90 minute focus energy
non sleep deep rest. mentioned previous episodes, lot
evidence, non sleep deep rest protocols can enhance accelerate
plasticity. think recent striking one study referenced last
time caption notes. cell press article, Cell Reports, great journal.
showing 20 minute, kinda shallow naps non sleep deep rests, can
facilitate sensory motor learning. go another learning bout caffeine
free. learning bout different morning one. work bout
learning bout clear common focus regime come
non sleep deep rest. not ingesting caffeine wanna make sure
can sleep later night really well. And, tends creative type
work. Now, creativity topic gonna spend entire month coming
soon. creativity interesting state mind which, taking existing
elements. Things already know, rearranging ways novel.
say, well, duh, creativity is.

46:26 Creativity Two-Part Phenomenon

creativity two parts. creative discovery mode kind
shuffling things around relaxed way kind playful exploring


different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

different configurations. creativity also has, absolutely linear implementation
mode. take idea design come create
something robust concrete. creativity really two part thing.
first part actively exploring different configuration, sometimes playful way,
sometimes way almost random just kind exploring. state
definitely facilitated relaxed almost sleepy. not state
personally can access well early day. tried access coming
sleep one say, well still sleepy early day just doesn't
work. write down. complete garbage.
found block afternoon 90 minutes where, can creative
type writing creative type imagination of, scientific ideas experiments might
wanna do. Science might not seem like creative endeavor many you, is.
lot imagining this, combine thinking novel
concepts ways arranging things. find kinda clear
common focused mode, creative works tend come well regimes.
Now know lot people rely substances access creative
states. not marijuana user. just not drug me, variety reasons.
not drinker. not substance variety reasons. know, not
cop not tell people shouldn't do. problem
using substances access creativity, generally substances relax people,
will allow get creative brainstorming mode, not good linear
implementation mode. know, day remarking friend
ads, advertisements seen years, just
incredible. just tell are. not cryptic anything. revealing
tastes here. particular perfume ad Spike Jones made just
amazing. put link cause just cool. don't want give away end
feature particularly interesting neuroscientist. just
cool. 'Cause grew skateboarding thing, knew little bit Spike's movies
skateboarding course made lot impressive, popular movies
well, full length features. don't know personally, isn't plug. Not
needs endorsement anything all. amazing thing
advertisement collection things never really think
combined, involves different speeds motion sorts effects. mean,
like real classic like Spike Jones kind delivery. But, incredible think


not just fact someone imagine actually implement
steps order create that, see realize ton work.
can't just put together randomly. lot people, not Spike clearly, lot
people incredible mind ideas novel arrangements things,
great accessing state not good accessing implementation state.
also true lot people tend fall call
kind like Asperger's autism end spectrum, good linear
implementation. Now not talking forms autism course. sensitive
fact many forms spectrum. But, people good
linear implementation. that's, separate state creative state. So,
afternoon block try access freer kind looser mindset
associated fatigue comes later afternoon. And,
state favors creativity creative learning, might better morning. don't
know. gonna decide. gonna late shifted.
gonna morning shifted. alertness, generally
good linear implementation, good activating no-go pathway
suppressing action, good pursuing particular goals strategy
implementation. tend relaxed, tend almost
kind sleepy mode. me, coming one non sleep, deep rest modes
sleep, tend better novel configurations

51:15 Psychedelics

existing elements, creativity. brings question get,
time. is, psychedelics? So, going talk, experts
psychedelics. hope bring in. Actually speaking people coming
creatures coming. creature definitely not psychedelics doesn't need
Costello just arrived. seems sleepy state most, time. Hey
buddy, doing? come in, yep. working 15th sleep deep rest
episode day generally followed 10 12 hour deep rest episode,
almost exclusively comprised REM. know 'cause eyes open 'cause
droopy, can't close way eyes going like this.
going count. So, yeah, nice big yawn. Okay so, psychedelics. First
all, wanna clear. neither proponent, somebody rejects


potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate

Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just

recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-

tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

potential role psychedelics. however, think psychedelics, can
particularly hazardous, people preexisting psychological issues,
not working board certified, psychiatrist physician, well essentially
kids. think young brain basically psychedelic state just
naturally. kidding aside, think young brain subject
neuroplasticity, drugs, like psychedelics powerful, can
detrimental developing brain. just stance. anyone disagrees me,
happy chat polite discourse. happy listen
well tell believe based data. mentioning psychedelics
many asked. deal psychedelics. least
work. nutshell, psychedelics thought unleash sensory processing
make less filtered. lot different inputs eyes, ears,
nose, taste, et cetera coming time parallel.
mechanisms suppress allow us focus things
happening. Visually, generally don't synesthesia unless us happen
synesthesia. don't blend see hear way,
confusing us. know making sounds know visual stimulus.
psychedelics, people report able smell colors to, know, hear trees, et
cetera. lot sensory blending. led
misconception, sensory blending itself, creative process. nothing
creative sensory blending. know there's, essence creative process,
novel configuration elements, whether not notes piano,
whether not words page, whether not numbers whether not
movement. way configured new way,
algorithm, way which, configured makes sense observer.
key thing. seems people report psychedelic experiences,
makes lot sense person experiences it, observer. so,
creative works definition new ways configuring things lend
bigger greater deeper novel understanding part observer. just
sensory blending not gonna accomplish that. Now true great review
journal cell, excellent journal psychedelics work. turns out,
don't just work, allowing sensory blending. do, way
activate certain serotonin receptors et cetera. lend
lateral connectivity different brain areas, novel associations.


principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access

interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

principle, principle, say not necessarily practice, principle,
allow different areas brain. Maybe even two sides brain communicate
broadly normally. certain elements speak
creativity. But, can't simply case psychedelics portal creativity.
creativity, mentioned before, involves not just novel associations
breaking kind space-time rules, also involves reconfiguring things,
new space-time rule one comes with, interesting, stimulating kind
many cases, delightful observer. why, many claims that, know,
psychedelics open plasticity increase creativity. not sufficient
personally. curious about, not just open creative thinking process,
novel configuration process? also, lend implementation
creative works? answer is, no. cases nothing creative
implementation. Now, think that, may come time certainly clinical
trials happening now, psychedelics leveraged toward particular
clinical goals. wanna tip hat work Johns Hopkins happening
now, really lends itself, idea early preliminary data
papers coming really fantastic. Showing may
excellent roles certain psychedelics certain clinical context. clinical
studies done psychiatrist present, authorized that. can help
people depression, trauma, et cetera. gonna spend lot time
talking that, including folks running studies. can
look forward that. say that, no don't take psychedelics access
creative states. not think major role, important role psychedelics
might show going humanity. think may important roles
clinical context. Provided done legally safely. think that, creative
process two-stage process means that, personally best served
period non-linear exploration concepts. Whatever happen working
afternoon. actually shelve work. just set aside
revisit next day even next day, see whether not work
ready deliberate linear implementation wanna one
highly focused states. So, long short way saying that,
alert, linear type operations. tend sleepy relaxed,
creative works can first conceived, implementation requires high
levels alertness.



58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative

don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,

terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know

way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night

58:20 Afternoon Light Insurance

Now, gets us kind late afternoon evening. Now am, mentioned
before, proponent getting sunlight evening well. critical thing
not mentioned before. works. Many people now heard
say getting light early day important. will advance one's clock. It'll make
wanna get earlier next day. getting light evening accomplishes two
things me. First all, makes sure don't get early not waking
3:00 4:00 morning going shift clock. going delay
little bit. really important. want keep schedule normal
routine, regular 24 hour cycle not circadian rhythms sleep
wakefulness drifting place want predictability
mind going work order optimize learning performance. Well, need
get morning light evening light. morning light going advance clock.
Make system wanna get earlier. evening light going delay clock
little bit average kind bookends circadian mechanisms.
basically wanna go sleep less time night wake up,
less time morning. works. hard
wired mechanism. not subjective thing tell myself. hardwired
mechanism. So, gets us evening. generally evening get light
going outside sometimes turning artificial lights brightly,
start dim evening 'cause mentioned many times not
gonna belabor point. wanna minimize light exposure, especially overhead
bright light exposure, regardless whether not blue light not. evening
10:00 PM 4:00 AM. asked, wait thought 11:00 PM
4:00 AM? Well, is, 10:00 PM 4:00 even better. just
originally said 10:00 PM 4:00 AM, people like impossible people
adhere to. me, screens off, dim lights, favors falling asleep
good night's sleep me.

1:00:26 Evening Nutrition

Since talking food earlier, just revisit little bit said before.


evening meal tends carbohydrate rich more. proteins, there'll
like eggs, fish chicken something sort no protein. eat high
carbohydrates. not one people keto high meat only, anything
like that. Remember, fasting low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness sleepiness. stimulate
release tryptophan transition sleep. late day.
Also, exercised early day, especially weight bearing exercise
everything's weight bearing exercises. suppose unless astronaut.
space. early day, exercising weights long run,
sooner later, need replenish glycogen. And, realized ketonisters
gonna say,

1:01:21 Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

well, know, gluconeogenesis will allow replenish glycogen, et cetera. just
gonna call lie right now, feel like it. 'cause think just
hasn't stated. that, not everybody, lot people
proponents high meat keto diets, fine. fine wanna do.
recall, relatively ketogenic diet day, alertness fasting. lot
people, can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-
called gluconeogenesis enhance protein synthesis. hormone
enhanced. around while. know looks like. either thyroid
enhanced hormone enhanced don't pass judgment. look
people look amazing keto able lot energy replenish
glycogen keto, many cases, not all, many cases
hormone enhanced. taking exogenous hormones, allow synthesize,
repair muscle ways people aren't taking exogenous hormones
can't. not just true men way. also true women.
whole discussion probably not directly related month podcast.
So, don't mind people this, one problem people following
ketogenic diets way sleep trouble sleep
long bouts fasting trouble falling asleep. makes sense.
autonomic arousal tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, dopamine release. lot energy


hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying
draw fire, do, happy conversation, that. Again, no
judgment, think people not aware
variables. Remember, good science isolating variables. oftentimes
seeing social media, getting presented single variables not
seeing full context variables manipulated. So, eat pasta
rice vegetables things like evening. Also, just find, maybe
becoming one last people that. Although hope not. hope
others like me. literature speaks fact carbohydrates not
that, also help maintain, healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
bias. do. avoid caffeine whatnot evening. take
supplements happy point put complete list supplements
take there. general, core things do. relate
lot questions

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

cetera. think important recognize people just go no-

really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

hard time calming getting deep sleep. tend achieve state
using carbohydrates also replenishes glycogen. again, know, not trying

1:04:11 Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal Easy Solve

asking time. next piece scientific data gonna
describe important piece scientific data, sake understanding
optimize brain access sleep. also can help avoid lot anxiety issues.
relate data Charles Czeisler, doctor. MD Charles Czeisler's lab
Harvard Medical School. run sleep lab Harvard Medical School. long
time now impressive work. shown peak output,
circadian clock wakefulness, words peak wakefulness,
suppression sleep signal, actually happens late day.
trough activity body temperatures lowest right waking. wake
body temperature goes afternoon continues go
tends fall evening towards bedtime. brief blip, release
peptides substances sleep centers brain,
suprachiasmatic nucleus sleep center preoptic area, wanna
look up. preoptic area not far circadian clock signals peak
alertness wakefulness hour, bedtime. say, whoa,
really weird. lot people get bed. ready go sleep


wide awake. think unnatural thing something wrong
them. actually not. believed, don't know, again, wasn't consulted
design phase. believed, signal helpful human beings start
gathering resources securing night's sleep we,
know, historically vulnerable attack humans animals
forth. desire run around clean kitchen organize things,
just general feeling internal anxiety, late evening, natural blip
naturally passes 45 60 minutes. Now often time people
start stressing fact something next day worry
not able sleep can cascade whole set things. another
thing throughout day know early day gonna alert, afternoon
gonna kinda sleepy. evening comes around, addition
things doing, anticipate, peak alertness activity. don't worry
it. use perhaps get organized next day basically, just go
through, gonna anything, gonna mundane task like cleaning
things require almost zero effort. probably speaks cleaning abilities
too. But, fact matter don't just go drift off sleep. blip
alertness right sleep hope just cognitively knowing will helpful
people.

1:07:08 Power Objective Tools

raises, yet another theme think going important. is,
physiological mechanisms. Like changes alertness. using breathing tools.
Something talk future episodes shift levels autonomic arousal.
concrete, biological phenomenon. fasting. Fasting will increase
alertness way. caffeine. Not everybody's susceptible caffeine
degree others But, physiological mechanisms. know receptors. know
ligands called bind receptors. know mechanisms.
involve cortisol epinephrine. sorts things personally try
leverage, toward learning optimization brain, activity.
physical activity early day instance, tends give us longer duration, wake
signal, intends accelerate waking early day. working late
day can sometimes cause people trouble falling asleep. will also phase


delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think


specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak

specialized circumstances. little bit like examples see
news where, oh, so-and-so stroke spontaneously speaks new
language. don't know answer is. shows brain associative
networks typically suppressed can unleashed. certainly
don't wanna go give stroke deliberately try unmask skill,
no concrete way go way really know
gonna offset detrimental effects stroke. fact, think it'd
terrible idea. think trying describe typical, don't know
typical normal. mean, told otherwise, certainly not normal. terms
way structure day,

1:11:34 Mini-Synthesis

think normal. pretty normal. tend wake right around, don't know,
somewhere 5:30 7:00 AM, depending night
before. tend go sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00. tend one bout
morning can really focused hard work can really activate go
pathway also activating no-go pathway can really stay focused.
rely tools. period afternoon get sleepy kinda
like think people. tend come recognizing opportunity
slightly sleepy state creative work thinking things novel ways. get
light couple times day. eat low carb day, don't say high,
know, higher carbs eat starches, evening. way can sleep. then,
really anticipate late afternoon peak alertness. Excuse me, late night peak
alertness many people confuse insomnia challenges actually
really quite normal circadian cycle. fall asleep. goes well,
stay asleep four five hours. Typically three four wake up. think
like people wake middle night. Now, one thing don't
think discussed lot one colleagues Stanford sleep lab tells
that, every hour half so, wake up. even look around,
believe not go right back sleep. don't recognize it. Waking
periodically sleep norm. not abnormal. don't know hasn't
discussed prominently. tend wake bright light coming
blinds, noise upstairs, Costello's snoring particularly


loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
regular basis reflexively. wanna emphasize whole day doesn't just consist
two 90 minute bouts. not way schedule works not
way lifestyle arranged. fortunate 'cause enjoy things


well. many school family demands
demands, key slot brain optimization segments 90
minutes, one two, maybe per day. trying slot wherever
can amidst other, obligations things need do. But, wanna
intelligent way anchored biology. wanna
number things talked today, order optimize sessions

1:18:33 Organizational Logic

get them. round up, acknowledged
covered huge range topics, related optimize learning, brain change,
essentially mental performance. set context, biological
mechanism like basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, circadian autonomic system,
relationship food fasting particular types food
alertness sleepiness. Linear focus strategy implementation best served high
alert states, although not alert, creative states, least first phase
creativity, creative arrangement, kind brainstorming stage supported
states kind relaxation even slightly sleepy. creative implementation
linear focused deliberate process, much like highly focused state,
described. described things just give context. lot
asked for, know, order set within context. no means
rigid times ways things. But, think fair say that,
circadian logic. also grounding biological mechanisms concrete.
know cells mechanisms neuro-transmitters.
little bit headed the, call, kind emerging, or, know,
don't wanna say cutting edge, maybe front edge neuroscience starting
understand creativity forth. areas just now, coming
clarity. certainly still lot work do. lot
different ways arrange one's routine. hopefully, tools practices
described, will useful you.

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk
morning means driveway driveway. old dog.
hearing background distracting, now know why.
probably relates to, level autonomic arousal. leave

delay. make wanna wake later next day. not just 'cause
tired. 'cause shifted clock

1:08:14 Visualization

activity temperature. Many people ask subjective tools plasticity.
visualization? Can just imagine particular activity, will help
us get better activity? evidence visualization can that,
true. important distinction. personally, don't much,
deliberate visualization. First all, get best ability, achieve best ability
visualize things kind sleepy state. don't know
able to, direct brain towards internal visualization eyes closed. generally
fall asleep can't remember anything thinking before.
people, work done many years ago Roger Shephard
others. Roger Stanford labs done too, course,
rotating objects physically mind, way improving looking speed
spatial calculations forth. people good visualization. can
close eyes can just see objects rotate deliberately, et cetera.
lot people like me, start that, mind drifts easily. like
think reasonably focused person waking state. So, visualization
interesting 'cause think people attracted idea, can just think
something get better way. probably true, can
linear way visualize things. wanna repeat that. think
visualization certain power. can remain linear deliberate
focused, visualization. many people like challenged,
maintaining linear focus eyes closed, visualization, don't get much
visualization. think data performance really supports that. Now
examples instance, people will injure one limb will exercise
intact limb, non-injured limb rather. will visualize opposite limb.
Sometimes even use mirror boxes. say left limb injured.
maintaining activity right limb using mirror box looks like
left limb working well. Yes, top-down feedback mechanisms,
support idea injured limb can rehabilitate quickly, et cetera. But,
fairly elaborate schemes. don't want mirror boxes around house. think

1:20:22 Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

wanna mention lot people ask specific tools practices.


asked Wim Hof Breathing, ice baths. talked little bit ice baths
think cold exposure. binaural beats things sorts. think
way look tool, modulate measure nervous system, ask whether
not going move down, state autonomic arousal. Whether not
gonna can make alert calm. focused less focused. kind
two axes need think about. Sometimes wanna alert
are. indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring level alertness up. cautionary notes
associated those. need read understand cautionary notes,
yourself. Everybody's different carry certain dangers,
certain conditions. Others huge margins safety. ice bath generally wakes
up. warmer, hot bath generally calms down, right? Binaural beats, aren't
lot data quality peer-reviewed journals. put effort go search out.
few. Binaural beats listening frequencies sound slightly differ
offset two ears. shown, can shift brain particular states.
notice today, didn't really talk alpha theta gamma rhythms. personally
reviewing literature, don't think fair say alpha states great X
theta states great Y. besides, us aren't walking around homes
workplaces, geared EEG machines wires skull.
don't know states anyway. think subjective reading
whether not one alert, calm, whether not alertness calmness
matches goal thing trying achieve terms learning, including
sleep, valuable, internal tool recognition can have.
words, want alert need alert exhausted,
might tools use wake up. might also speak fact might
not slept well night before. really
match autonomic arousal scale
trying achieve. indeed, gonna lot tools including supplements
prescription drugs things can help, move us along autonomic
continuum, toward alertness toward calmness. ultimately
tailoring alertness calmness specific types learning activities
going perform. And, reciprocal. Meaning activities
like exercise early day will increase level autonomic arousal alertness.
Certain foods, will tend wake up. Certain foods will tend make sleepy


volume food timing food factor also. huge parameter
space. huge set variables, impacts whether not feeling well,
performing well, learning great, not learning great. key thing become
observer, system works you. And, recognize
two bins tools optimizing, learning brain performance. One, tools
really anchored biological mechanism certain are. talked
those. other, subjective tools, visualization,
might work terrifically well. you, one song might really wake
associations it. me, might just, know, might repel
room. 'Cause don't like might put sleep. course, volume
kind universal. Loud music tends wake people up. Soft music, doesn't tend
wake quite much. So, part today really getting think about,
scientific way, structured way, non-negotiable elements
going period every 24 hour cycle tend awake,
period tend asleep. leverage not
fighting uphill battle wake actually, want
sleepy not trying go sleep naturally, going awake.
lot really anchors back core mechanisms biology,

1:24:42 Variation Among People, Dogs

start layering different protocols food supplementation, et
cetera. think important recognize people just go no-
go. people, just calmer harder time getting action
activity. just way wired. us autonomic nervous systems
geared towards parasympathetic, calm states. One reasons love
bulldogs, not just bulldog, calm animals. fact, make no
spontaneous movements unless something respond to. find
incredibly relaxing. animals like pit bulls, also really like enjoy
species, tail always wagging. always position make
movement second 'cause tend ride pretty high levels autonomic
arousal. pop really quickly. say time go walk, Costello
one limb time. sometimes just goes back sleep. so,
people like too. know particular


goals trying pursue. final closure this, wanna emphasize today
always,

1:25:49 Accurate Versus Exhaustive

strived accurate. sure made mistakes, will point
appreciate that. post correction, agree indeed misspoke,
misguided something. But, no means exhaustive. mean, might've exhausted
information wasn't exhaustive. Meaning, no way
cover ways which, optimize can optimize learning performance.
think touched number hope, find value
explore lives. continuing theme
do, podcast. stay one theme entire month. next episode,
going explore two, essential aspects neuroplasticity. actually relate
learning. pain, pain management, neural regeneration.
that, don't injuries don't suffer chronic pain, discussion still gonna
important one. not just going pain trying
get rid of. also going certain sensory experiences, within pain
network, can become amplified, well can use top-down modulation.
can use mind, suppress pain response. also gonna talk
hardwired mechanisms, bottom up, exist periphery, body
control pain. also gonna discuss, number interesting interactions
pain system learning system. you're, not interested pain per
se, still going valid conversation sake understanding
optimize brain performance. neuro-regeneration goes hand hand,
discussion. hope join us that. suppose remiss didn't mention
that, Costello snoring extremely loudly today. good long walk

loud, might get up, might, go use restroom. might, know, pick book
read low light something

1:13:31 Resetting Clock

generally fall back asleep wake up, typical time again, 5:30 7:00
morning. waking middle night thing mentioned
beginning podcast episode today, not necessarily abnormal. probably
reflects, real time meaning, time go sleep probably
closer eight o'clock. word midnight literally supposed mean mid night. We,
many meaning us meant go sleep wake rise, know,
setting rising sun. know beautiful study
University Colorado, took people wilderness reset
circadian clocks, measured way melatonin cortisol. completely
whack interacting screens staying late, et cetera.
basically view sunrise view sunset evening almost
not students, them, got onto schedule naturally
wanted go sleep sunset wake around sunrise just sunrise, even
brought back normal artificial light setting. think
natural pattern just deviated artificial lights. waking 3:00
4:00 doesn't necessarily mean something screwed you.
anxiety something, although might. likely means
supposed go bed much earlier. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system much easier us push, delay sleep
time accelerate wake-up time. words, easier stay
hang party even don't wanna wake
exhausted fast sleep. people pushing through, late hours
evening night going bed much later naturally want to.
personally don't want go bed 8:00 PM. lot good things happen
8:00 PM 11:00 PM. so, wanna enjoy those. push
evening hours. consequence, running melatonin. melatonin
release basically subsided 3:00 4:00 makes sense
wake up. don't take melatonin reasons discussed previous episodes.
rely things like magnesium glycinate magnesium threonate, things like theanine.


not saying need take those. just happened take

1:15:55 Don’t Trust Mind Now

order facilitate sleep. great benefit me. wake
middle night anxious whatever reason mind looping,
couple rules. One is, don't trust anything think about. wake middle
night, it. Unless magnificent dream wanna write down,
every while. Typically go back read it, not
magnificent. can't ever remember coming anything really fantastic one
dreams stuck me, implemented. don't really trust kind thinking
happens wee hours circadian cycle me. just nothing either
terribly creative, worth linear implementation time. But, one thing
helpful sometimes one non sleep deep rest protocols
way go back sleep. hypnosis app scripts Michael Sealey
mentioned before, Reveri Health, yoga nidra protocol.
useful helping turn off,

1:16:59 Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

kinda looping thinking middle night fall back asleep. reviewing
schedule you, just context implement certain types tools
optimizing learning. Realize that, gives impression 90 minute bout
learning work morning 90 minute bout creative type work
afternoon it. lot hours course, just wanna
clear. hours occupied pretty not mundane tasks things
kinda random. things like email attending Zoom meetings meeting
colleagues students things sort. sometimes will read just sake
enrichment. mentioned two 90 minute bouts
two 90 minute bouts trying expand on, mental capacities already
have. really trying stretch grow able
