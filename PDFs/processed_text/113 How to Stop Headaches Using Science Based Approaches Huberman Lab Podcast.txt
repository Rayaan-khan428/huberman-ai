Constantly expanding again, That’s livemomentis.com Huberman, talk headaches
soon going learn, different types headaches different types
headaches arise changes different types tissues head area indeed
neck area well. Now, one key things understand want relief
headache need understand tissue mainly involved creating type
headache. So, instance, many people suffer called tension headaches
now. Tension headaches little bit misnomer, many people might think oh
tension, lot tension stress, therefore get tension headaches
indeed stress can cause tension headaches, tension. Headaches really sort
headache feel around top part head, not top sort
put headband eyes around head. doesn't
experienced way around head, main underlying reason, tissue
system mainly underlies tension. Headaches muscular system. lot
muscles skull Believe Not, course, neck, allow move

muscles will undergo excessive amounts constriction. Now are, course,
muscles jaw can also lead headache jaw ache, things sort
neck aches headaches. really pointing muscles
key player formation different types headache, Tension, Headache
particular, course muscles muscle tension can evolved types
headaches well. Okay, just want highlight muscular issues one particular source
ache headaches, tissue can prominently involved generating
ache headache so-called meninges. Now meninges, addition fun
word say, bunch tissues, line outside brain reside
brain skull. might think okay brain skull, probably
just little bit fluid brain right next skull, turns out. That’s not
case. brain actually encased thick, durable, Sac casing. That’s
wrapped around tight like Saran wrap. actually name dura d-u-r-a,
can remember, Dura, durable and, done surgeries, many surgeries
brains different types, ranging Human, even though not neurosurgeon

two sources pain. ache headache, two
need think trying better understand different types headaches
discuss terms trying understand going best treatments
different types headaches neural inflammatory responses, talk
neural type. First, type headache many people unfortunately
suffer get bunch detail moment, called cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches headaches arise not surface. People don't


experience kind tightening forehead neck jaw. rather
feels headache coming deep within head particular behind

experienced cluster headaches. extremely painful, even
say, relatively minor cluster headaches extremely painful severe ones
exceedingly painful. Cluster headaches arise Deep get Sensation
rising deep within head, opposed surface inward,
neural origin particular nerve pathway called trigeminal nerve.
often origin cluster headaches people experience behind eye.
trigeminal, name suggests, three branches: try, Okay, branch
essentially extends eye, also branch extends mandible right
uh. lip branch extends less nasal area,
trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed ways, hyper activated cases
causes Deep pain eye. first branch trigeminal
nerve, ophthalmic branch tends activated first, people start
feeling pain behind eye, particular one side, oftentimes,
lacrimation, tearing there, can Nasal discharge, another common
symptom type headache - cluster headache, pupil sometimes
will become small, pupils eyes won't dilate even darkness.
bunch things going one sides face seem

That’s it’s neural origin. Okay, got muscular origins headaches.
got meningeal origins headaches, stuff around brain
relates vasculature, neural origins headaches and, course,
inflammation origins headaches. Now. Inflammation term gets thrown around lot
days. People talking about. know reduces inflammation inflammation

treatments going quickly completely relieve type headache.
Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across

life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding

headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno

00:07:47 Headache Sources: Muscle Tension; Blood Flow & Meninges

Constantly expanding again, That’s livemomentis.com Huberman, talk headaches
soon going learn, different types headaches different types
headaches arise changes different types tissues head area indeed
neck area well. Now, one key things understand want relief
headache need understand tissue mainly involved creating type
headache. So, instance, many people suffer called tension headaches
now. Tension headaches little bit misnomer, many people might think oh
tension, lot tension stress, therefore get tension headaches
indeed stress can cause tension headaches, tension. Headaches really sort
headache feel around top part head, not top sort
put headband eyes around head. doesn't
experienced way around head, main underlying reason, tissue
system mainly underlies tension. Headaches muscular system. lot
muscles skull Believe Not, course, neck, allow move


neck head. lot muscles lie parallel skull oftentimes.
muscles will undergo excessive amounts constriction. Now are, course,
muscles jaw can also lead headache jaw ache, things sort
neck aches headaches. really pointing muscles
key player formation different types headache, Tension, Headache
particular, course muscles muscle tension can evolved types
headaches well. Okay, just want highlight muscular issues one particular source
ache headaches, tissue can prominently involved generating
ache headache so-called meninges. Now meninges, addition fun
word say, bunch tissues, line outside brain reside
brain skull. might think okay brain skull, probably
just little bit fluid brain right next skull, turns out. That’s not
case. brain actually encased thick, durable, Sac casing. That’s
wrapped around tight like Saran wrap. actually name dura d-u-r-a,
can remember, Dura, durable and, done surgeries, many surgeries
brains different types, ranging Human, even though not neurosurgeon
clinician ranging Human types species. find dura
exceedingly durable. Getting thing really requires sharp razor blade,
brain actually sitting fibrous like Sac simply not open
fingertips conditions. It’s really durable, meninges general area
also encasing brain meninges provide additional buffer brain
dura skull. don't want think brain just sitting
right next skull. It’s close by, bunch thin fibrous tissues, many
thin fragile others dura very,
strong, fibrous, almost like uh ever felt, instance, Sale
sailboat, might think. Oh it’s just big flapping sheet wind. anything
sheet Wind. very, strong durable material. Now proximity
dura meninges brain fact everything wrapped tightly
together fact lot vasculature, arteries. Blood
vessels capillaries area. top brain throughout brain,
fact close proximity wrapped really tight durable
sac one reasons why, blood vessels arteries become dilated,
open. creates pressure brain tissues isn't
much distance tissues like dura meninges skull also
pressure allows brain literally sneak up, say, give impression
Brain expanding skull, point that, muscular


tension can give rise headache, thing can give rise headache so-called
vasodilation, expansion widening arteries, blood vessels capillaries,
one Reasons gives rise headache simply not lot
space expansion go. doesn't allow anything, except brain, push

even though brain doesn't pain receptors, That’s right. brain doesn't
pain receptors. neurosurgeon can take off piece skull can probe

get skull, course, little skin flap remove removed Skull -
requires little bit topical anesthetic, really don't need anesthetic
go brain itself, aren't pain receptors brain itself. However,
tissues surrounding brain, dura meninges vasculature
reaches up, believe not skull. vasculature doesn't actually stop right
beneath skull actually blood vessels get skull actually portals
blood can move within skull itself. Well, means that, since
tissues close compact, respect one another, increase
size portals allow movement blood fact
called nociceptors noci nociceptors. essentially pain receptors
presence pain receptors tissues around brain. increase
size vascular portals arteries capillaries vessels, experience
intense pain pressure. fortunately excellent treatments dealing
intense pain pressure. keep mind intense pain pressure,
consequence vasodilation, widening different vascular portals,
different type pain

00:14:06 Headache Sources: Neurons; Inflammation & Sinus Headache

arises muscular tension, case Tension, Headache. Okay, now
two sources pain. ache headache, two
need think trying better understand different types headaches
discuss terms trying understand going best treatments
different types headaches neural inflammatory responses, talk
neural type. First, type headache many people unfortunately
suffer get bunch detail moment, called cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches headaches arise not surface. People don't


experience kind tightening forehead neck jaw. rather
feels headache coming deep within head particular behind
orbit one eyes, sometimes eyes ever
experienced cluster headaches. extremely painful, even
say, relatively minor cluster headaches extremely painful severe ones
exceedingly painful. Cluster headaches arise Deep get Sensation
rising deep within head, opposed surface inward,
neural origin particular nerve pathway called trigeminal nerve.
often origin cluster headaches people experience behind eye.
trigeminal, name suggests, three branches: try, Okay, branch
essentially extends eye, also branch extends mandible right
uh. lip branch extends less nasal area,
trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed ways, hyper activated cases
causes Deep pain eye. first branch trigeminal
nerve, ophthalmic branch tends activated first, people start
feeling pain behind eye, particular one side, oftentimes,
lacrimation, tearing there, can Nasal discharge, another common
symptom type headache - cluster headache, pupil sometimes
will become small, pupils eyes won't dilate even darkness.
bunch things going one sides face seem
arise deep within head it’s almost it’s coming brain outward
That’s it’s neural origin. Okay, got muscular origins headaches.
got meningeal origins headaches, stuff around brain
relates vasculature, neural origins headaches and, course,
inflammation origins headaches. Now. Inflammation term gets thrown around lot
days. People talking about. know reduces inflammation inflammation

treatments going quickly completely relieve type headache.
Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.

headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change

headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not
traumatic brain injury can experience headaches consequence hitting
head. line traumatic, brain injury lower level brain injury one still
seeks definition. fact, one major goals clinical field relates
concussion. know it’s also. comes lot discussion football?
know days, see players hit really hard depending whether not
laying five seconds 30 seconds three minutes, know crowd
uh. people watching television everywhere else speculating
whether not person allowed play quite direct. really no
way assess extent brain damage consequence hitting one's head
one's head hit, because, first all, almost best ways detect traumatic

lowered, cognition disruption mood, sleep, Etc actually consequence things
Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't
many options. terms type work so, prone
concussions head injuries simply virtue work. Without any, know millions


dollars, contracts opportunities necessarily cases do, necessarily
things, certainly car accidents bike bicycle accidents not voluntary
events, point traumatic, brain injury headache related traumatic, brain injury
extends far Beyond realm sports, fact, look numbers,
find 90 percent traumatic brain injury, people coming
hospital clinic people claiming got consistent, headaches, they're, not
sleeping well, mood off they're, feeling irritable hit head. Even
not consequence sports. It’s going consequence accidents either
workplace terms bicycle sorts Transportation. Based accident,
like car accident, mind, kind head hit certainly involves concussion
traumatic. Brain injury often leads headaches either infrequent severe headaches
chronic low-level headaches feeling, kind stuffiness fullness head.
can lot different Origins that. common origin going actual swelling
the, not necessarily brain tissue directly. recall discussion
meninges, include dura tissues surround brain, they're,
actually three layers, call meninges durages one
little space those, brain, meninges Surround skull, it’s
called subarachnoid space, cool right arachnoid, like spider. Well, even
slight bit swelling brain even distant brain tissue. So, instance, even

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness

compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something

two sources pain. ache headache, two
need think trying better understand different types headaches
discuss terms trying understand going best treatments
different types headaches neural inflammatory responses, talk
neural type. First, type headache many people unfortunately
suffer get bunch detail moment, called cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches headaches arise not surface. People don't


experience kind tightening forehead neck jaw. rather
feels headache coming deep within head particular behind
orbit one eyes, sometimes eyes ever
experienced cluster headaches. extremely painful, even
say, relatively minor cluster headaches extremely painful severe ones
exceedingly painful. Cluster headaches arise Deep get Sensation
rising deep within head, opposed surface inward,
neural origin particular nerve pathway called trigeminal nerve.
often origin cluster headaches people experience behind eye.
trigeminal, name suggests, three branches: try, Okay, branch
essentially extends eye, also branch extends mandible right
uh. lip branch extends less nasal area,
trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed ways, hyper activated cases
causes Deep pain eye. first branch trigeminal
nerve, ophthalmic branch tends activated first, people start
feeling pain behind eye, particular one side, oftentimes,
lacrimation, tearing there, can Nasal discharge, another common
symptom type headache - cluster headache, pupil sometimes
will become small, pupils eyes won't dilate even darkness.
bunch things going one sides face seem
arise deep within head it’s almost it’s coming brain outward
That’s it’s neural origin. Okay, got muscular origins headaches.
got meningeal origins headaches, stuff around brain
relates vasculature, neural origins headaches and, course,
inflammation origins headaches. Now. Inflammation term gets thrown around lot
days. People talking about. know reduces inflammation inflammation
bad - suppose cases inflammation really widespread across

course, think people interested today's discussion, different treatments
different types headache, why? different treatments work,
understanding little bit pain arises nervous system certainly

00:23:21 3 Neuron Types, Pain, Tension Headaches



treatments going quickly completely relieve type headache.
Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized
one area know, back head front head one side
head others, That’s often case tension.

still pretty debated. One thing know sure females suffer migraine
headaches, rate least threefold higher males, surprisingly, not
seem direct hormonal origin, also going talk hormonal
headaches. headaches relate dip estrogen progesterone, particular
phase menstrual cycle. ovulatory cycle. bit mystery
Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes
hormones, still appears case overall migraines common. Now
numbers migraine, just common migraine is, extremely wide. little
bit frustrating researching episode. will find, instance, 17 women
suffer migraines. will also hear six percent males suffer migraines.
will also hear 43 43 percent females suffer migraine. recurring headaches

headaches recurring basis, definition migraine, headache one
key definitions. can say sure many many millions people, maybe
even billions people, suffer migraine headaches, it’s kind staggering thing
contemplate, know it’s extremely common know it’s prevalent
females studies will find terms compare overall

not seem related ovulatory menstrual cycle. interesting
facts related I'll, just know, touch moment, pregnancy, whatever


reason seems protective migraine headaches, is, women suffer

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic

particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make

bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled

omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing

omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats

offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find

people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron

neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way

behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced

point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms

two sources pain. ache headache, two
need think trying better understand different types headaches
discuss terms trying understand going best treatments
different types headaches neural inflammatory responses, talk
neural type. First, type headache many people unfortunately
suffer get bunch detail moment, called cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches headaches arise not surface. People don't


experience kind tightening forehead neck jaw. rather
feels headache coming deep within head particular behind
orbit one eyes, sometimes eyes ever
experienced cluster headaches. extremely painful, even
say, relatively minor cluster headaches extremely painful severe ones
exceedingly painful. Cluster headaches arise Deep get Sensation
rising deep within head, opposed surface inward,
neural origin particular nerve pathway called trigeminal nerve.
often origin cluster headaches people experience behind eye.
trigeminal, name suggests, three branches: try, Okay, branch
essentially extends eye, also branch extends mandible right
uh. lip branch extends less nasal area,
trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed ways, hyper activated cases
causes Deep pain eye. first branch trigeminal
nerve, ophthalmic branch tends activated first, people start
feeling pain behind eye, particular one side, oftentimes,
lacrimation, tearing there, can Nasal discharge, another common
symptom type headache - cluster headache, pupil sometimes
will become small, pupils eyes won't dilate even darkness.
bunch things going one sides face seem
arise deep within head it’s almost it’s coming brain outward
That’s it’s neural origin. Okay, got muscular origins headaches.
got meningeal origins headaches, stuff around brain
relates vasculature, neural origins headaches and, course,
inflammation origins headaches. Now. Inflammation term gets thrown around lot
days. People talking about. know reduces inflammation inflammation

different sources pain different types headache, will also talk about.
course, think people interested today's discussion, different treatments
different types headache, why? different treatments work,
understanding little bit pain arises nervous system certainly

treatments going quickly completely relieve type headache.
Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

course, transmitted kissing sexual contact, That’s not origin it.
Okay, can passed skin contact mucosal contact, um, mucosomucosal,

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache

accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like

photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great
results seen non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Again, want highlight
none approaches necessarily designed done
replacement prescription drugs. physician, excellent prescription
drugs physician can prescribe treatment headache.
Nonetheless, think many people listeners podcast interested
things can order inoculate themselves, least reduce likelihood

neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound

move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not

Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't

extends far Beyond realm sports, fact, look numbers,
find 90 percent traumatic brain injury, people coming
hospital clinic people claiming got consistent, headaches, they're, not
sleeping well, mood off they're, feeling irritable hit head. Even
not consequence sports. It’s going consequence accidents either

combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,



01:28:11 Hormone Headache Treatment & Omega-3s

significant impact reducing headache, frequency intensity found, and, just
briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual
syndrome related headaches. refer earlier hormone-based
headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number

uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

treatments going quickly completely relieve type headache.
Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.

headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward

just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing

That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency

touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,

photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great

sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized

Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not

Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't

extends far Beyond realm sports, fact, look numbers,
find 90 percent traumatic brain injury, people coming
hospital clinic people claiming got consistent, headaches, they're, not
sleeping well, mood off they're, feeling irritable hit head. Even
not consequence sports. It’s going consequence accidents either
workplace terms bicycle sorts Transportation. Based accident,
like car accident, mind, kind head hit certainly involves concussion

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.

consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources

01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring

pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal

brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-

caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-

supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain

Okay, next three five minutes - promise no going explain
pain arises level nerve cells - suppose one times when,
highlighter pen go across microphones speakers leading
ears - use tell perhaps one
important things understand nervous system. brain you,
trillions neurons - hear trillions different
types neurons brain come different shapes sizes different
things make dopamine make Serotonin make glutamate,
key distinction among different types neurons. three types
neurons believe everybody scientists are. No everybody understand exist
neurons nerve cells call motor neurons sense control
contraction muscles, sometimes walking neurons control. movements
fingers, scientists call digits ones, toes. also control beating
heart, although That’s slightly different mechanism slightly different type
tissue involved generating motor movements limbs. neurons
call motor neurons goal purpose - say - don't really
know goal purpose is, make sure muscles
contract, certain things happen body like Heart beats, move
limbs, lift eyelids eyebrows rather forth. types
neurons call Sensory neurons. communicate way motor
neurons that. fire? call Action? Potentials just electrical signals
release neurotransmitters like neuron, respond certain events
environment environment within body, not responsible
generating muscular contractions. call Sensory neurons. Sensory,
neurons sense, light touch. Sensory, neurons sense, firm touch, sensory,
neurons, sense, pain, Sensory, neurons sense light brushing skin. fact,
Sensory neurons, believe not. respond specifically light, brushing
hand across skin, region body, particular region body
happens hair stroke skin direction hairs lay down.
experience pleasurable, whereas, stroke direction opposite
way hairs lay down, experience not pleasurable, Sensory neurons
respond cases, instance, within auditory system. respond sound
waves eye. respond photons light, sometimes photons light
particular wavelengths think red, green, blue on. Sensory neurons, don't


move muscles, respond things environment exist within us.
Sensory neurons sense, instance, pressure within head pressure within
gut full empty gut pain within tissues, like liver kind
internal organ. got motor neurons, Sensory, neurons last kind
neuron call modulatory neurons. ones adjust relationship
sensory neurons motor neurons determine whether not
anything response sensory input. whether not sensory, neuron fires
sends electrical potential, whether not will generate motor change. Let give
simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front
touch top hand fingertip can deliberately override is. can
modulate typical reflex, that, something touches us, not
aware it’s coming from, typically move away thing. touches
natural response, can decide not going move away. can decide
stay still can decide move toward thing touches us, typically,
walk somebody touch them, either turn toward
side touch they'd, step Away, it’s rare going step you,
decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages
disadvantages, but, can quickly see, going different types
headaches different approaches treating headache. keep back
mind neurons contract muscles create movement tension
muscles, remember can turn off neurons allow muscles relax.
Sensory neurons sense, input actually sense pain
modulatory neurons, can allow adjust relationship sensory
neurons motor neurons and, course, probably screaming
now saying wait. ever want deal motor neurons
modulatory neurons want just go straight source just cut off pain?
Ah well, problem many painkillers issues well. particular,
can sedative. Many can habit forming even addictive, many
people, not many people don't want take drugs. Whether not they're, over-
the-counter prescription drugs even natural supplement based type treatments,
rather use, instance, behavioral approach can modulate.
can deliberately turn off communication Sensory

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized

Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not
traumatic brain injury can experience headaches consequence hitting
head. line traumatic, brain injury lower level brain injury one still
seeks definition. fact, one major goals clinical field relates

know days, see players hit really hard depending whether not
laying five seconds 30 seconds three minutes, know crowd
uh. people watching television everywhere else speculating
whether not person allowed play quite direct. really no
way assess extent brain damage consequence hitting one's head
one's head hit, because, first all, almost best ways detect traumatic
brain injury, except severe ones, tend require lot large equipment like

lowered, cognition disruption mood, sleep, Etc actually consequence things
Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache

accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense

people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking

neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown

Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great

simple example this, listening I'll, just explain
watching able see. holding hand front

decide not going move away step direction
touch That’s modulatory neurons can adjust conversation
context-dependent way. whether not sensory neuron will cause motor
neurons contract not, okay, got motor neuron, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons you're, probably thinking now. talking this?
thought talking headache. thought going talk treatments
headache, turns important imagine -
moment explain how. say tension headaches, you're, somebody
classic symptoms tension. Headache. Let tell are.
headaches occur less kind headband like fashion,
tend start exist around that. common. can arise
number different sources rise sleep deprivation. can rise excessive use
caffeine. Intake talk is, can arise stress. can arise
low level, viral infections bacterial infections, experience just
headaches, thinking hard working hard life
stressful. often also associated jaw pain jaw, tightness neck tightness,
tension headaches everything imagine muscular tension cause. Well.
want treat tension headache, can imagine that, headache neural,
want go sort neural mechanism treat them. course now


know three types neurons. motor neurons, Sensory, neurons
modulatory neurons, choices, can say. Okay, want turn off
muscles head jaw neck hyper contracted? instance, want take
muscle, relaxer relaxedant, want try change sensory input itself?
Maybe don't change way muscles behaving shut off sensory part it,
ability sense it. certainly ways can that, want adjust
modulatory neurons? want make headache,
don't perceive headache cut off communication sensor
motor muscles relax turns out? treatments approaches
every one those. every one different advantages

00:31:05 Tension Headaches

Neurons motor neurons turns approaches exist well. Okay,
point promise not going give biology lesson terms
pain, sensing headaches uh conceptual phenomenon. Instead, like
next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around
forehead area eyes often also include jaw neck muscles can
extend even upper back again. can caused low level infection,
often not tension type headaches going come
chronic psychological stress, usually combined lack sleep, usually combined
lifestyle issues and, course, without getting long discussion it, anytime,
lack sleep going excessive stress anytime. excessive
stress, you're, going make sure offsetting getting proper sleep,
people don't excessive stress. way excellent tools.
grounded excellent science available zero cost. experienced
chronic stress even short-term stress, master stress episode human Lab
podcast just go Hubermanlab.com That’s time stamped you. Tension type
headaches begin less headband pattern, can really extend tissues
well, not often face, really head often will start climb toward
top head. not always Halo pattern. Sometimes can localized
one area know, back head front head one side
head others, That’s often case tension.

generally disorders recurring attacks headaches, people get migraines often
get recurring fashion. people get often people get less
often, migraines debilitating. numbers prevalence migraine
still pretty debated. One thing know sure females suffer migraine
headaches, rate least threefold higher males, surprisingly, not
seem direct hormonal origin, also going talk hormonal
headaches. headaches relate dip estrogen progesterone, particular
phase menstrual cycle. ovulatory cycle. bit mystery
Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes
hormones, still appears case overall migraines common. Now
numbers migraine, just common migraine is, extremely wide. little
bit frustrating researching episode. will find, instance, 17 women
suffer migraines. will also hear six percent males suffer migraines.
will also hear 43 43 percent females suffer migraine. recurring headaches
qualify migraine headaches 17 percent men suffer migraine
headaches recurring basis, definition migraine, headache one
key definitions. can say sure many many millions people, maybe
even billions people, suffer migraine headaches, it’s kind staggering thing
contemplate, know it’s extremely common know it’s prevalent
females studies will find terms compare overall
prevalence headache. It’s going higher substantially higher females males
not seem related ovulatory menstrual cycle. interesting
facts related I'll, just know, touch moment, pregnancy, whatever


reason seems protective migraine headaches, is, women suffer
recurring migraines get pregnant get pregnant often
Give birth experience fewer migraine headaches, may something hormonal.
may something else. know sure? know headache is,

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make

bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled

omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing

omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats

people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust

me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing

headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,
effects Omega-3s cluster headaches types headaches,
least knowledge, not evaluated. no reason think Omega-3s
not beneficial types headaches, least far data sets
talked concerned. clear. Omega-3 fatty acids going
potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion
cells, really just mouthful nerd, speak neurons eye connect

fact, one important areas brain connect relates
photophobia, area structure called thalamus. thalamus egg-like
structure sits center brain serves kind switchboard like
sensory relay information coming eyes ears Touch

different areas brain, think kind like old-fashioned, switchboard
um, think it. Uh sort like airport. go uh particular um wing
airport. go particular gate on, getting funneled progressively

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno

next talk different types headaches, think something That’s
important not often discussed, except people that, unfortunately
suffer repeatedly certain kinds headaches like migraine cluster tension.
Headache, think people experience headache again,


everybody point - experiences headache rather just think headache, one
thing understanding major types headache differ similar
one another will Really help identify best source treatments are.
like talk different types headache now. first type headache
going discuss tension, type headache again. Tension type headaches tend
start off, not always, tend start off less Halo headband around

Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get
picture. different underlying biologies. next type headache cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches ones mentioned earlier arise deep within
head. feel coming inside tend one side

course, transmitted kissing sexual contact, That’s not origin it.
Okay, can passed skin contact mucosal contact, um, mucosomucosal,

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not
traumatic brain injury can experience headaches consequence hitting
head. line traumatic, brain injury lower level brain injury one still
seeks definition. fact, one major goals clinical field relates
concussion. know it’s also. comes lot discussion football?
know days, see players hit really hard depending whether not
laying five seconds 30 seconds three minutes, know crowd
uh. people watching television everywhere else speculating
whether not person allowed play quite direct. really no
way assess extent brain damage consequence hitting one's head
one's head hit, because, first all, almost best ways detect traumatic
brain injury, except severe ones, tend require lot large equipment like
MRI functional MRI CT scans, none available side field
locker room, also many many, not most, effects traumatic brain
injury going occur. Not immediate minutes, even hours injury,
several hours days even weeks injury, discussion hold
off longer full episode traumatic, brain injury, keeping mind, course, football
Salient example traumatic, brain injury concussion, boxing even
soccer heading ball, Believe Not, repeated low level impact forehead
parts head can give rise time. Traumatic brain injury without

related concussion actually occupies just tiny fraction majority traumatic, brain
injury concussion, traumatic, brain injury concussion, low-level brain
injury. can accumulate time become traumatic sake daily living.
lowered, cognition disruption mood, sleep, Etc actually consequence things
Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't
many options. terms type work so, prone
concussions head injuries simply virtue work. Without any, know millions


dollars, contracts opportunities necessarily cases do, necessarily
things, certainly car accidents bike bicycle accidents not voluntary
events, point traumatic, brain injury headache related traumatic, brain injury
extends far Beyond realm sports, fact, look numbers,
find 90 percent traumatic brain injury, people coming
hospital clinic people claiming got consistent, headaches, they're, not
sleeping well, mood off they're, feeling irritable hit head. Even
not consequence sports. It’s going consequence accidents either
workplace terms bicycle sorts Transportation. Based accident,
like car accident, mind, kind head hit certainly involves concussion
traumatic. Brain injury often leads headaches either infrequent severe headaches
chronic low-level headaches feeling, kind stuffiness fullness head.
can lot different Origins that. common origin going actual swelling
the, not necessarily brain tissue directly. recall discussion
meninges, include dura tissues surround brain, they're,
actually three layers, call meninges durages one
little space those, brain, meninges Surround skull, it’s
called subarachnoid space, cool right arachnoid, like spider. Well, even
slight bit swelling brain even distant brain tissue. So, instance, even
Whiplash swelling tissue, muscular tissue neural tissue

No, not getting sufficient sleep, not getting sunlight right times day getting

laboratory studies, exploring role creatine clinical setting. like highlight
paper literature now will make clear creatine interesting
fact, effective treating headache particular headache caused head, hits
traumatic brain injury. title paper prevention traumatic headache, dizziness

pre-clinical study blank. means almost always study performed
animal models, mice, rats, primates, Etc. clinical trial something That’s carried
humans, pilot study means study carried humans, fairly
small cohort, fairly small group, uh limited number subjects. Nonetheless,
data robust, case paper, think it’s worth paying attention


study, looked creatine Administration,
people ingest certain amount creatine I'll. Tell moment fluid,
taken water. Milk without food doesn't really matter time day

look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine

kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense
bodily weakness even mental weakness, mental weakness little bit hard quantify,
careful distinguish cognitive mental fatigue versus
physical somatic fatigue. acknowledge occur TBI post-tbi.
headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant

described earlier now. lot data centered around General topic,
going focus three main papers, haven't told yet, course
compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual

headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement

Mystery is: migraine headaches occur greater frequency
females? Even independently menstrual cycle, control changes
hormones, still appears case overall migraines common. Now
numbers migraine, just common migraine is, extremely wide. little

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get
picture. different underlying biologies. next type headache cluster
headaches. Cluster headaches ones mentioned earlier arise deep within

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not
traumatic brain injury can experience headaches consequence hitting
head. line traumatic, brain injury lower level brain injury one still
seeks definition. fact, one major goals clinical field relates
concussion. know it’s also. comes lot discussion football?
know days, see players hit really hard depending whether not
laying five seconds 30 seconds three minutes, know crowd
uh. people watching television everywhere else speculating
whether not person allowed play quite direct. really no
way assess extent brain damage consequence hitting one's head
one's head hit, because, first all, almost best ways detect traumatic
brain injury, except severe ones, tend require lot large equipment like

several hours days even weeks injury, discussion hold
off longer full episode traumatic, brain injury, keeping mind, course, football
Salient example traumatic, brain injury concussion, boxing even

related concussion actually occupies just tiny fraction majority traumatic, brain
injury concussion, traumatic, brain injury concussion, low-level brain
injury. can accumulate time become traumatic sake daily living.
lowered, cognition disruption mood, sleep, Etc actually consequence things
Sports. So, instance, bicycle accidents, playground, accidents, construction
accidents often forgotten reason. sports, particular football,
tend grab attention, relates concussion. Keep mind that, certain
people path living people, traumatic, brain injury going occur car
accident, construction, work types work people generally don't
many options. terms type work so, prone
concussions head injuries simply virtue work. Without any, know millions


dollars, contracts opportunities necessarily cases do, necessarily
things, certainly car accidents bike bicycle accidents not voluntary
events, point traumatic, brain injury headache related traumatic, brain injury
extends far Beyond realm sports, fact, look numbers,
find 90 percent traumatic brain injury, people coming
hospital clinic people claiming got consistent, headaches, they're, not
sleeping well, mood off they're, feeling irritable hit head. Even
not consequence sports. It’s going consequence accidents either
workplace terms bicycle sorts Transportation. Based accident,
like car accident, mind, kind head hit certainly involves concussion
traumatic. Brain injury often leads headaches either infrequent severe headaches
chronic low-level headaches feeling, kind stuffiness fullness head.
can lot different Origins that. common origin going actual swelling
the, not necessarily brain tissue directly. recall discussion
meninges, include dura tissues surround brain, they're,
actually three layers, call meninges durages one
little space those, brain, meninges Surround skull, it’s
called subarachnoid space, cool right arachnoid, like spider. Well, even
slight bit swelling brain even distant brain tissue. So, instance, even
Whiplash swelling tissue, muscular tissue neural tissue

animal models, mice, rats, primates, Etc. clinical trial something That’s carried
humans, pilot study means study carried humans, fairly
small cohort, fairly small group, uh limited number subjects. Nonetheless,
data robust, case paper, think it’s worth paying attention


study, looked creatine Administration,
people ingest certain amount creatine I'll. Tell moment fluid,
taken water. Milk without food doesn't really matter time day
people take creatine. people take creatine traumatic brain injury

look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine
monohydrate, typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day, 100
kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense
bodily weakness even mental weakness, mental weakness little bit hard quantify,
careful distinguish cognitive mental fatigue versus
physical somatic fatigue. acknowledge occur TBI post-tbi.
headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant
impact headache long term, creatine monohydrate. studies
people. TBI, it’s also important highlight fact many many people suffer
tbis mentioned earlier now treatments TBI. tend get
basic advice coming back again, think it’s excellent advice, know, get proper

surprised many people go right back work to,
know sympathetic fact many people just can't stop working


go disability. many people go back work. sport
kind work subject perhaps getting TBI, maybe
getting less rest consequence - stress obviously stress confounding issue
TBI, sleep exercise: Sun nutrition. things proper social connection
people encouraged TBI, compounds,

compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements

something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found

um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-

associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping

process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache

accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency

current lights nightstand whatever room happen
red lights, red Lights also, mention useful limiting
amount cortisol, stress hormone healthy us release high levels early
day, fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels. It’s another reason why?
say relevant photophobia, want keep cortisol levels low
evening night, indeed improve transition sleep, indeed
sleep overall, reducing cortisol evening time night time Extremely beneficial
red lights will help accomplish that. talked episode light

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order

so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,

omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic

bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health

Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference

looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant

randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one

this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion

see infrared can even heat sense. short wavelength light going light.
That’s That’s bright, blue, green, it’s common fluorescent bulbs
commonly used household lighting workplace lighting forms artificial

night artificial sources order not send wake-up signals eye brain
rest Body, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells also known connect areas brain. Many areas brain,
fact, one important areas brain connect relates
photophobia, area structure called thalamus. thalamus egg-like
structure sits center brain serves kind switchboard like
sensory relay information coming eyes ears Touch

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great
results seen non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Again, want highlight
none approaches necessarily designed done
replacement prescription drugs. physician, excellent prescription

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,

omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic

bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,

Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference

looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race

energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.

randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half

00:43:10 Cluster Headaches

Type headache experiencing different treatments work key. Okay,
tension, type, headaches, migraine type headaches think starting get

00:47:47 Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle & Menopause



Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness

experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources

almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.

randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one

headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,
effects Omega-3s cluster headaches types headaches,
least knowledge, not evaluated. no reason think Omega-3s
not beneficial types headaches, least far data sets
talked concerned. clear. Omega-3 fatty acids going
potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno

Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns

That’s gene expression. really going change identity

course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak

follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular

progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense

headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant

so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,

omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health

Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources

That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.

Nerve little bit, fortunately excellent treatments. next type
headache quite common, hormonal headaches. Now phrase hormonal
headache already cue fact it’s far General term
many different hormones. Testosterone, estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone
on, many different functions brain body every
single hormone particular so-called steroid hormones steroids, again, not just
limited things people take Sports. fact, steroid hormones refers estrogen
testosterone sort make men women make naturally
steroid hormones can impact gene expression. can are, course, turns
growth breast tissue testicular tissue hair growth on,
That’s gene expression. really going change identity
function cell, long term, right, going literally change breast tissue change
penile tissue change ovarian tissue sort consistent way across
lifespan, can bet Changes gene expression changes gene
expression occur steroid hormones incredible ability sort like
X-Men hormones pass outer membrane cell, call
extracellular membrane so-called nuclear membrane. can go area
genes made turn off different genes. However, multitask
life - is, steroid hormones like estrogen particular, testosterone particular,
can also bind surface cells impact sorts things level cells
nothing changes gene expression second mechanism binding
surface cells one ways estrogen can control different aspects
headache. Now doesn't necessarily mean estrogen gives headaches. fact, it’s
just opposite. turns low estrogen another hormone low progesterone
combine give rise headache ways low estrogen low
progesterone impact, vasodilation vasoconstriction, inflammatory response
talk deal hormone-based headaches. particular hormone
headaches occur low estrogen progesterone moment, key
thing know something covered fertility episode. long,
detailed episode fertility, not going going go significant detail. Now
can refer episode probably detail ever wanted, also lot
tools relates fertility males females. right now, just going give
course overview 60 120 seconds, understand
hormonal headaches likely take place. Keep mind hormonal headaches
likely take place estrogen progesterone lowest.
understand follicular stage ovulatory slash menstrual cycle, okay,


menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent

100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people

headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources

almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources

That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense

kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches

menstrual cycle 28 days average, not everyone. it’s 20 days
average first half estrogen starts creeping
learn endocrinology, estrogen, primes progesterone, estrogen will Peak
start fall pretty quickly right time egg ovulates egg released
will essentially ready fertilization egg fertilized whole bunch
things happen relates pregnancy. not, ends happening
ludial phase, second half menstrual cycle, buildup
lining uterus increase progesterone. estrogen goes
follicular phase, goes progesterone goes
important generating thick lining uterus allow fertilized egg it’s fertilized
implant it’s not fertilized. gets released body bleeding
process call menstruation menstruation occurs day, one menstrual cycle
considered first day bleeding occurs. Well, then, means
estrogen already low, remember, estrogen low start follicular
phase went up. comes right time ovulation
progesterone goes luteal phase. fact, it’s thousand
fold increase progesterone, no fertilization egg progesterone starts
coming down. mean? means that, first
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, first first day bleeding
fourth fifth day menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone very,
low. time beginning menstrual cycle, first
week menstrual cycle many women prone hormonal headaches
hormonal headaches, not estrogens High. That’s common misconception rather
estrogen progesterone low, now understand Contour
underlying reasons hormonal headache, can start ask well
happens estrogen low. Well, estrogen strong impact vasodilation
vasoconstriction system, progesterone talk little bit later, now
know hormonal headache least one particular type hormonal
headache, very, common. Given number women menstruating
fact low estrogen low progesterone cause hormonal headache
fact that, course, women no longer menstruating, they're, either
perimenopause menstruation, becoming infrequent menopause
deceased entirely. Well now understand origin hormonal headache
is, need know estrogen progesterone normally order
prevent headache thereby know exactly offset. prevent



00:53:38 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Headache, Baseline Health

Treat hormonal headache first week menstrual period, last type
headache like discuss headache associated head hits. traumatic,
brain injury, although definitely want underscore fact even people not

01:02:08 Tool: Headache Treatment, Creatine Monohydrate & TBI



feel it’s important conversation head next segment,
can take reduce headache order address this, going start
first headaches associated head hits traumatic brain injury Turns
out, surprising useful approach that, approach also
can help offset treat headache conditions well, meaning not just
headaches caused traumatic brain injury, also headaches caused sudden onset
Tension, Headache migraine. Headache, even perhaps again, perhaps, cluster type
headaches. first substance like highlight shown

many know, something people supplement take. often creatine
discussed context muscle performance, not just people weightlift
people endurance exercise, it’s often said 5 10 grams per day

laboratory studies, exploring role creatine clinical setting. like highlight
paper literature now will make clear creatine interesting
fact, effective treating headache particular headache caused head, hits
traumatic brain injury. title paper prevention traumatic headache, dizziness

pre-clinical study blank. means almost always study performed
animal models, mice, rats, primates, Etc. clinical trial something That’s carried
humans, pilot study means study carried humans, fairly
small cohort, fairly small group, uh limited number subjects. Nonetheless,
data robust, case paper, think it’s worth paying attention


study, looked creatine Administration,
people ingest certain amount creatine I'll. Tell moment fluid,
taken water. Milk without food doesn't really matter time day

motivation behind study. authors hypothesize basis pre-clinical data
animals, increasing creatine stores within brain, not just muscle,
particular within brain availability creatine allow better cognitive
function general. Now didn't look cognition specifically paper,
look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine
monohydrate, typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day, 100
kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense
bodily weakness even mental weakness, mental weakness little bit hard quantify,
careful distinguish cognitive mental fatigue versus
physical somatic fatigue. acknowledge occur TBI post-tbi.
headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant
impact headache long term, creatine monohydrate. studies
people. TBI, it’s also important highlight fact many many people suffer
tbis mentioned earlier now treatments TBI. tend get
basic advice coming back again, think it’s excellent advice, know, get proper
amounts sleep, get exercise don't get another traumatic brain injury. That’s obvious,
surprised many people go right back work to,
know sympathetic fact many people just can't stop working


go disability. many people go back work. sport
kind work subject perhaps getting TBI, maybe
getting less rest consequence - stress obviously stress confounding issue
TBI, sleep exercise: Sun nutrition. things proper social connection
people encouraged TBI, compounds,
particular, few: over-the-counter compounds known safe,
shown efficacy dealing TBI. think that, pilot study - can
consider preliminary - think it’s important enough effects dramatic enough -
people headache particular people TBI, consider
supplementing creatine order deal Headaches course, eagerly
await studies, exploring role high dosage creatine, relatively
high dosage creatine monohydrate offsetting headache. Meanwhile, think
number people suffering headache might consider using creatine
monohydrate exploratory fashion seeing whether not helps offset

next, find extremely exciting. Why? Well, describe compound, or,
say, set compounds available counter shown
effective reducing frequency intensity headaches not just one kind
headache. multiple types headaches, describe shown
significant effects reducing intensity frequency tension, type headaches, migraine
type headaches well hormone type headaches related menstrual cycles
described earlier now. lot data centered around General topic,
going focus three main papers, haven't told yet, course
compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,
effects Omega-3s cluster headaches types headaches,
least knowledge, not evaluated. no reason think Omega-3s
not beneficial types headaches, least far data sets

potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed

look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine
monohydrate, typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day, 100
kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense

headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant

accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021

omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense

photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s

approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something

01:02:08 Tool: Headache Treatment, Creatine Monohydrate & TBI



feel it’s important conversation head next segment,
can take reduce headache order address this, going start
first headaches associated head hits traumatic brain injury Turns
out, surprising useful approach that, approach also
can help offset treat headache conditions well, meaning not just
headaches caused traumatic brain injury, also headaches caused sudden onset
Tension, Headache migraine. Headache, even perhaps again, perhaps, cluster type
headaches. first substance like highlight shown
significantly reduce intensity frequency headaches creatine. Now creatine,
many know, something people supplement take. often creatine
discussed context muscle performance, not just people weightlift
people endurance exercise, it’s often said 5 10 grams per day
creatine monohydrate. Depending much weigh 5 10 grams per day
creatine, monohydrate can increase, creatine phosphate stores muscles can bring
water muscles, can make stronger, get increased power output, true.

laboratory studies, exploring role creatine clinical setting. like highlight
paper literature now will make clear creatine interesting
fact, effective treating headache particular headache caused head, hits
traumatic brain injury. title paper prevention traumatic headache, dizziness
fatigue creatine Administration. Now keep mind. pilot study.

pre-clinical study blank. means almost always study performed
animal models, mice, rats, primates, Etc. clinical trial something That’s carried
humans, pilot study means study carried humans, fairly
small cohort, fairly small group, uh limited number subjects. Nonetheless,
data robust, case paper, think it’s worth paying attention


study, looked creatine Administration,
people ingest certain amount creatine I'll. Tell moment fluid,
taken water. Milk without food doesn't really matter time day
people take creatine. people take creatine traumatic brain injury

look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine
monohydrate, typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day, 100
kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people
experiencing fatigue acute fatigue chronic fatigue again, not chronic fatigue
syndrome per se, chronic fatigue, study, defined. general sense
bodily weakness even mental weakness, mental weakness little bit hard quantify,
careful distinguish cognitive mental fatigue versus
physical somatic fatigue. acknowledge occur TBI post-tbi.
headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant
impact headache long term, creatine monohydrate. studies
people. TBI, it’s also important highlight fact many many people suffer
tbis mentioned earlier now treatments TBI. tend get
basic advice coming back again, think it’s excellent advice, know, get proper
amounts sleep, get exercise don't get another traumatic brain injury. That’s obvious,
surprised many people go right back work to,
know sympathetic fact many people just can't stop working


go disability. many people go back work. sport
kind work subject perhaps getting TBI, maybe
getting less rest consequence - stress obviously stress confounding issue
TBI, sleep exercise: Sun nutrition. things proper social connection
people encouraged TBI, compounds,
particular, few: over-the-counter compounds known safe,
shown efficacy dealing TBI. think that, pilot study - can
consider preliminary - think it’s important enough effects dramatic enough -

next, find extremely exciting. Why? Well, describe compound, or,
say, set compounds available counter shown
effective reducing frequency intensity headaches not just one kind
headache. multiple types headaches, describe shown
significant effects reducing intensity frequency tension, type headaches, migraine
type headaches well hormone type headaches related menstrual cycles
described earlier now. lot data centered around General topic,
going focus three main papers, haven't told yet, course
compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual

headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published

02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light

otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron

uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources

seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic

hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes

structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing

omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats

offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find

one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number

people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust

me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic

pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown

kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people

experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s
considered safe dosages used study certainly sports performance
well, compounds shown significant

headache. multiple types headaches, describe shown
significant effects reducing intensity frequency tension, type headaches, migraine
type headaches well hormone type headaches related menstrual cycles

compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

significant impact reducing headache, frequency intensity found, and, just
briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual

headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,

potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense

people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches

ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great

concussion creatine's ability communicate calcium ATP system
motivation behind study. authors hypothesize basis pre-clinical data
animals, increasing creatine stores within brain, not just muscle,
particular within brain availability creatine allow better cognitive
function general. Now didn't look cognition specifically paper,
look aspects. bad stuff associated TBI people
supplement creatine level much higher typical level people
supplement creatine Simply Sports Performance. So, mentioned before,
people, supplement creatine sports performance, take creatine
monohydrate, typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day, 100
kilograms greater body weight, 100 kilograms 200 approximately 220. pounds.
dosage used supplementing creatine study address potential
impact creatine headache, dizziness fatigue, quite bit higher
dosages used simply muscle performance. study people take dose
0.4 grams creatine monohydrate per kilogram body weight somebody weighs


100 kilograms 220 pounds 40 grams creatine per day. someone weighs
half much, take 20 grams creatine per day, period
six months. know take creatine day day
buildup creatine stores, muscles within brain tissue, now
found consequence creatine Administration really striking and, think
quite exciting. found significant decrease frequency headache people
supplementing creatine, opposed controls. Now keep mind
pilot study, effects dramatic. found statistically
significant decrease increase frequency headache people taking
creatine. fact, look controls - see basically getting
headache frequency 90 percent TBI, reduction headache
frequency 10 12 percent people taking creatine. That’s quite
quite dramatic effect look measures, took keep mind again.
pilot study, limited number subjects. results
impressive. found number people experiencing dizziness
significantly reduced people supplementing creatine, number people

headache quite frequent. Basically, takeaway study people
experiencing headache, dizziness fatigue due TBI perhaps - want
underline - perhaps hasn't really explored yet, perhaps headache
dizziness fatigue due conditions, symptoms causes headache. Creatine
monohydrate supplementation might might excellent candidate people
try. say that? Well, first all, creatine monohydrate relatively inexpensive. It’s

intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual

headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health

transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number

uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily

thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms

greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources

almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches

compound referring to? over-the-counter compound? Well, turns
over-the-counter compound. not just available counter it’s also available
food, turns nutrition can strong impact frequency
intensity headache. Although supplementation particular compound can
accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant

caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal

particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

accomplish thing well. referring omega-3 fatty acids. Many
probably familiar omega-3 fatty acids. fatty acids come
form so-called EPA DHA omega-3 fatty acids commonly distinguished
so-called omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids come bunch different foods
they, course, can supplemented well. Omega-3 fatty acids come bunch
different foods can supplemented well. Common forms omega-3 fatty acids - or,
say, common sources omega-3 fatty acids Foods - include fatty ocean fish,
including salmon salmon skins, sardines, anchovies things sort. Common sources
supplement form so-called fish, oil capsules liquid fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids,
almost always, talking omega-3 fatty acids. talking
combination EPA DHA. really quantity EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
seems impactful sorts Health metrics going talk
minutes now respect omega-6 fatty acids. typical food sources


omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing

01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,

briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual

headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,

potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something

people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,

omega-6 fatty acids seed oils. know. Nowadays, seed oils become quite
controversial. given stance prior podcast, I'll, just repeat
haven't heard it. not belief seed oils bad,
inflammatory killing us making us sick, major cause
metabolic dysfunction, Etc. However, think clear - learned Dr Lane
Norton guest podcast taught us nutrition great depth.
highly recommend episode, interested nutrition, people consuming
lot oil generally lot oils people consuming nowadays
include lot so-called omega-6 fatty acids lot oils seed. Oils,
particular omega-6 fatty acid - That’s going relevant today's discussion linoleic
acid common lot seed oils. again, not going tell seed oils
bad. However, seem case many people consuming far
many seed oils and, consuming far many calories perhaps
consuming much Omega six fatty acids relative omega-3 fatty acids. Now,
said, think General agreement among nutritionists health
professionals stand get omega-3 fatty acids, perhaps
cardiovascular health, although That’s little bit debated, certainly immune system
function mood functioning Brain potent anti-inflammatory effects
Omega-3 Omega-3s can sourced food, animal based plant-
based. can simply go online look various food-based sources, thinking
headache different treatments headache. recent studies
exploring supplementing omega-3 fatty acids one case, supplementing
omega-3 fatty acids deliberately reducing amount linoleic acid, omega-6
fatty acids, can impact headache. first study like describe reference
role omega-3 fatty acids headache published 2018, title
paper long chain, omega-3 fatty acids headache U.S population.
number things really like study. include fact
looked enormous number people, is, included 12 317 men women.
like fact included men women study age, 20 older,
broke population categories included age. certainly looked race
ethnicity. looked educational background. looked body mass total
energy intake, really important. think it, people going eating
within thing things eat they're, going consuming Omega-3s,
hopefully well omega-6s eating far going get far
likely going get Far things ordinarily,
eating smaller amounts, controlled total caloric intake way find


particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources

people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust

conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one

pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal

brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,

curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms

particularly useful looking kind data. reason explored Omega-3s
worth mentioning. Omega-3 fatty acids known anti-inflammatory effect
anti-inflammatory effect mediated couple different Pathways. won't go
much detail now, omega-3 fatty acids keep mind actually make
various parts cells brain body. That’s right! membrane remember,
talked steroid hormones can go different membranes
cells, outer membrane inner membrane. lot actual membranes,
structural constituents neurons cells actually made of, include certain
fatty, acid, long-chain fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids important actual
construction tissues, well anti-inflammatory effects. things like
limiting prostaglandins things can cause inflammation okay,
bunch different ways omega-3 fatty acids can useful. refer study
earlier study looked so-called analgesic effect. pain, relieving effect analgesic
means pain, relieving effect omega-3 fatty acids randomized controlled
trial previous paper, found diets high Omega-3s low
omega-6s, okay, high three low six compared Diets just reduced
omega-6s, found greater analgesic effect increasing Omega-3s, also reducing
omega-6 fatty acids. So, context seed oil discussion, although keeping mind
omega-6s can come sources well, omega-6s just reduced
own, wasn't great, effect terms reducing pain inflammation,
omega-3 fatty Acids deliberately increased omega-6 fatty acids
reduced studies, ones controlled
things. Well, should, say, holding constant caloric intake. it’s not
just removing fat eating less fat, there's, actually removal certain fats
fatty acids replacement omega-3 fatty acids. one case,
case, it’s just reduction omega-6s you're, using food types macronutrients
offset reduction calories caused reducing omega-6s basic takeaway.
they're, relying marching study, increasing, Omega-3s reducing
omega-6s seems beneficial reducing pain. indeed, study find
something quite similar, hold caloric intake constant
look omega-6s, whether not decrease, omega-6 fatty acids not, find.
increasing omega-3 fatty acids diet either consumed food sources
supplementation, associated lower prevalence severe headache migraine
severe tension, type headache migraine? promising points fact
long chain, omega-3 fatty acids, likely either pain, reducing
evidence inflammation reducing effect can



01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,



01:28:11 Hormone Headache Treatment & Omega-3s

significant impact reducing headache, frequency intensity found, and, just
briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual
syndrome related headaches. refer earlier hormone-based
headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion

red light, allow stay awake, not hide covers,
experiencing photophobia addition - mentioned beginning episode -
many people find photophobia entry point trigger headache,
happens? start experience Aura, onset photophobia,
photophobia leads feeling malaise converts headache? so,
not lot clinical data just yet emerging idea realm
headache treatment idea can offset early signs, can offset


photophobia aura, perhaps Use dim red lights red lights,

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way

newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type

01:22:14 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids & Inflammation

Significantly reduce severity headache, tension type headache migraine.
That’s first study. second study recent study. published 2021
used a, say, less similar type overall design one refer
earlier. title paper dietary alteration call N3, omega-3
n6 omega-6. Sorry shift nomenclature, didn't write paper dietary alteration
omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids headache reductions adults migraine,
randomized control trial. Randomized control trials involve people
one condition one thing, get swapped randomly another
condition, serve internal control controls sorts things
like differences sex differences age, differences Health background number
variables, best one can study, people either ingest diet
increased Omega-3s, increased EPA DHA, increased EPA DHA reduced
amounts linoleic acid. Okay. That’s going reduce omega-6s control diet
people taking well, it’s essentially average intake Omega-3s omega-6s,
can probably already guess general results study going be.
general results reductions headaches. Okay, really cool thing
is: massive reduction headache. Okay, was, refer robust
reduction headache, particular, subjects increase Omega-3s
reduce amount linoleic acid took. thing really like
study that, don't know exact underlying mechanism effect,
spend time delineating omega-3 omega-6 fatty acids likely
either offset exacerbate headache. Now didn't say omega-6 fatty acids
exacerbate headache, seem people ingest linoleic, acid
omega-6 experiencing inflammation, evident bunch different
conditions. One, instance, increases things like cgrp cgrp molecule, That’s
associated calcium, signaling pathway, it’s involved vasodilation, expansion
blood vessels capillaries, That’s known, mentioned earlier, exacerbate
certain forms headache. Okay, also forms headache can caused
vasoconstriction. talk one dramatic example, perhaps get toward
end, it’s uncommon example, um it’s it’s called Thunderclap headache trust
me. not want Thunderclap headache. Um talk Thunderclap
headache little bit later, involves constriction blood vessels. case,


paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,



01:28:11 Hormone Headache Treatment & Omega-3s

significant impact reducing headache, frequency intensity found, and, just
briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual
syndrome related headaches. refer earlier hormone-based
headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,
effects Omega-3s cluster headaches types headaches,
least knowledge, not evaluated. no reason think Omega-3s
not beneficial types headaches, least far data sets
talked concerned. clear. Omega-3 fatty acids going
potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,

sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,

neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,

paper, didn't study mechanism directly, resting known analgesic
anti-pain, well known anti-inflammatory Pathways related increasing omega-3 intake
simultaneously resting idea think there's. think now can say
conclusion omega-6 fatty acids, particular linoleic acid, can increase inflammation
way increasing things like cgrp vasodilation Pathways related so-
called inflammatory cytokine Pathways whole discussion nowadays
called inflammatorium. basic takeaway interested reducing
headache, may beneficial, least according two studies another one
talk moment increase amounts omega-3 fatty acids, can done
ingestions foods, although, based dosages talk
moment, increasing omega-3 fatty acids taking liquid form fish oil, perhaps
cost effective way supplement Omega-3s capsules, perhaps
efficient way supplement Omega-3s, relate level one gram EPA per day.
Again, That’s EPA form particular, you're, instance, taking supplemental fish
oil you're, getting Omega-3s food getting determine 2
000 milligrams two grams per day Omega-3s, keep mind. That’s going include
EPA ndha, seem getting one gram per day EPA, omega-3 fatty
acids, either food supplements going critical threshold
reductions frequency intensity headaches. include tension.
Headaches migraine headaches now people will find actually ingesting far
omega-3 fatty acids generally supplementation can accomplished
Foods well can also beneficial things, mood indeed,
whole literature related effects Ingesting one three grams: again, three
grams per day EPA, That’s going require quite high intake Omega-3s
whatever form supplement decide take body, can
improve mood forth. basic range able find meta-analysis,
meta-analyzes researcher will look results bunch different studies,
focused thing. Look different strength studies. They'Ll,
sorts cool statistical gymnastics like remove potent study, one
greatest effect see whether not still effect treatment or,
instance, will swap different studies different combinations see
Whether not one study really leading conclusion given treatment
something case, meta-analysis omega-3 fatty acids, treatment
headache, includes different kinds headache found exploring
huge range Omega-3 supplementation, ranging 200 milligrams, way 2
000 milligrams per day. really one gram higher dosage per day,



01:28:11 Hormone Headache Treatment & Omega-3s

significant impact reducing headache, frequency intensity found, and, just
briefly earlier. mentioned that. Not omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation
shown effective reducing frequency intensity headache tension type
migraine type headache, it’s also shown improve outcomes premenstrual
syndrome related headaches. refer earlier hormone-based
headaches again. low estrogen low progesterone associated certain phases
menstrual cycle, well phase menstrual cycle, often associated
headache uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids premenstrual syndrome.
systematic review meta-analysis found, paraphrasing.
conclusion omega-3 fatty acids yes effectively reduce severity PMS
symptoms one symptoms particular found reduced.
pain related symptoms associated headache, actually
nice hypotheses likely be, fact point earlier studies,
omega-3 fatty acids actually considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
cases - indeed prescription forms omega-3 fatty acids -
highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food
matter leads many people conclude that, oh know, supplementation.
something um. know it’s going relatively weak minor impact things like
headache health metrics, just say fact exists
prescription, drug highest potency form, least opinion, points potency
omega-3 Fatty acids dealing analgesic effects reducing pain anti-
inflammation, well known cardiovascular improvements
associated increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake. Put simply Omega-3s not just
something comes food supplements. also marketed.
prescription drugs, think need considered quite potent least
far papers include meta-analyzes many papers data sets
indicate supplementing omega-3 fatty acids, point getting
one Gram per day EPA not just going beneficial treating reducing
frequency intensity one particular type headache, many types headaches


combine hormonal headaches, tension headaches migraine headaches,
account 70 percent total types headaches there,

least knowledge, not evaluated. no reason think Omega-3s
not beneficial types headaches, least far data sets
talked concerned. clear. Omega-3 fatty acids going
potent way reduce pain reduce

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion
cells, really just mouthful nerd, speak neurons eye connect
brain, so-called ganglion cells respond robustly bright blue light
shortwavelength light. got short wavelength light blue greens short

That’s That’s bright, blue, green, it’s common fluorescent bulbs
commonly used household lighting workplace lighting forms artificial

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches

highlight not think people need run get prescription form
omega-3 fatty acids, actually quite hard obtain quite expensive,
think oftentimes. talking something like omega-3 fatty acids, fact
available counter supplement liquid available food

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion
cells, really just mouthful nerd, speak neurons eye connect
brain, so-called ganglion cells respond robustly bright blue light
shortwavelength light. got short wavelength light blue greens short
wavelengths, long wavelet light, red know can even past
red will infrared. don't detect infrared consciously species like pit vipers can
see infrared can even heat sense. short wavelength light going light.
That’s That’s bright, blue, green, it’s common fluorescent bulbs
commonly used household lighting workplace lighting forms artificial
lighting. It’s also, course, present sunlight. Sunlight includes huge range
wavelengths, including long wavelength, light. course, seen Reds


oranges sunset on, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
eye respond best bright, green blue light, send connections bunch
different places brain, including so-called Central circadian clock superchiasmatic
nucleus, sets day night sleep wake rhythms. encourage people
view sunlight morning set system motion avoid bright light exposure
night artificial sources order not send wake-up signals eye brain
rest Body, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells also known connect areas brain. Many areas brain,
fact, one important areas brain connect relates
photophobia, area structure called thalamus. thalamus egg-like
structure sits center brain serves kind switchboard like
sensory relay information coming eyes ears Touch
system Etc funneled different compartments. thalamus sent
different areas brain, think kind like old-fashioned, switchboard
um, think it. Uh sort like airport. go uh particular um wing
airport. go particular gate on, getting funneled progressively
uh narrower narrower channels arrive particular plane much
way, thalamus bunch different entry points, it’s sensory information
coming bunch different sources sources get routed progressively
narrower narrower funnels eventually arrive accurate place function.
intrinsically photosensitive gangling cells send connections small important
area thalamus called LP. It’s denoted, L, letter P lateral, posterior
thalamus, say it’s lateral posterior nucleus thalamus uficionados
there, neurons location going respond. going
activated bright blue light, green light kind bright light originating artificial
sources sunlight neurons respond interesting
pattern connections. send connections so-called sensory cortex,
bunch different layers throughout cortex not associated visual perception.
not associated understanding shapes Contours
environment, rather neurons involved detection pressure, pain
forms sensory information level meninges talked
meninges earlier. again, brain not sensory system detect
pain, tissues around tissues around tissues, stuff around
meninges themselves, can respond pain intracranial. Pressure also relayed
meninges conscious awareness pain. mean
photophobia? means bright, blue light green light and, course, light


sunlight. activate neurons eye, intrinsically photosensitive ganglion
cells, activate lateral posterior, neurons, LP neurons LP neurons,
communicate areas brain specifically tuned different sensory
phenomena and, particular, pain level meninges intracranial pressure,
means headache simply photophobia
own, bright light actually trigger pain, sensing even creation pain
level meninges intracranial pressure. mean terms dealing
treating photophobia? Well, people deal photophobia deciding turn off
dim lights simply getting covers wearing um low, brim hat
putting sunglasses, want lie sometimes uh migraine
can associated Nausea even vomiting, it’s severe instances rather, one
simple way avoid activation retinal ganglion cells trigger
photophobia starting feel like migraine coming
photophobia coming shift using patterns light longer wavelength
domain, means practically Shifting using orange, ideally dim,
orange red light. Now. not call people go invest expensive red
light therapies. Admittedly, excellent case uses red light therapy,
particularly acne wound healing, even improving Vision, especially people beyond
age 40 hormone augmentation. talked episode
light health again, can find Hubermanlab.com everything time
stamped. talking simply red light bulbs hand
time need remain awake you're, starting experience. Photophobia
red light bulbs can purchased expensively. know, party lights,
can buy online, no specific need get uh. say red light. That’s
designed specifically photophobia anything sort can find cheapest um red
light available will simply work idea many people
experiencing photophobia, want reduce feeling pain pressure
head. Experience photophobia, also might want stay awake, get work
done things operating red light, or, say, living working, Etc
red light, allow stay awake, not hide covers,
experiencing photophobia addition - mentioned beginning episode -
many people find photophobia entry point trigger headache,
happens? start experience Aura, onset photophobia,
photophobia leads feeling malaise converts headache? so,
not lot clinical data just yet emerging idea realm
headache treatment idea can offset early signs, can offset


photophobia aura, perhaps Use dim red lights red lights,
described moment ago, might able reduce probability going
migraine type headache entirely. again, no need expensive red
lights, can find red lights easily online simply hand replace
current lights nightstand whatever room happen
red lights, red Lights also, mention useful limiting
amount cortisol, stress hormone healthy us release high levels early
day, fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels. It’s another reason why?
say relevant photophobia, want keep cortisol levels low
evening night, indeed improve transition sleep, indeed
sleep overall, reducing cortisol evening time night time Extremely beneficial
red lights will help accomplish that. talked episode light

lights not simply dimming ordinary artificial lights feeling turn off,
lights entirely going one relatively inexpensive or, say, Inexpensive
cases, red lights can found inexpensively online way able
continue daily activities

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.
go Hubermanlab.com website go menu click newsletter,
can scroll down. see tool kit sleep. completely zero cost


access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something

01:31:24 Tool: Aura, Photophobia & Offsetting Red Light

Inflammation ways can reduce frequency intensity different kinds
headache continue discussion many, not commonly known yet
potent treatments different forms headache. want touch topic mentioned
little bit earlier also provide treatment way alleviate something That’s
photophobia Aura. Now keep mind earlier referred Aura sense
something's happen, true meaning accurate description
Aura. oftentimes people also come understand Aura feeling something
surrounds given object visually even people sense something's around
them. again, can little bit vague. idea aura sense something
happen visually auditory way maybe even kind sense
something happen. certain environment reason making uh
kind Arc shapes hands just listening, making art
shapes hands aura often described kind Halo um emanating
one's body something looking again, nothing spiritual
context discussion migraine headache, rather many
people experience photophobia, sometimes aura. Sometimes no - just want
touch couple mechanisms aurum photophobia occur mentioned just
briefly - pretty well established way people can start offset photophobia again.
mentioned many people experience photophobia headache,
also number people experience photophobia, even don't intense
headaches. photophobia pretty common, pretty debilitate. actually one
reasons people feel not well need leave work not go school leave
school, kinds things lay bed day dim. lights not go outside again,
sunlight congruent health. can imagine photophobia can lead
sorts negative, Downstream consequences. Okay, Aura


photophobia? exact origins ARA aren't exactly clear, generally thought
Aura represents called spreading, depression, not depression
one's mood, although can associated that. depression neuronal activity,
neurons communicate one another generating electrical impulses travel
length so-called axons, like little wires,
dump neurotransmitter so-called synapse impact electrical activity
Neurons depression electrical or, say chemical electrical. Chemoelectrical
proper term phenomenon excitability neurons reduced.
doesn't anything depression mood State per se. Rather, reduced
excitability neurons it’s shown Imaging studies aura associated
back front back brain front spreading depression like wave
lowering levels electrical excitability originates visual cortex,
back, That’s part brain making sense visual images coming
eyes relayed stations brain people will start
see kind Halo light start feel light around literally
surrounding body object body looking
spreads forward brain That’s tends stretch so-called
sensory modalities. Sensory modalities. things like touch hearing, people will get
sense kind seeing something periphery Vision. start
feeling something around them. sense something's happen,
this: spreading wave depression goes Back Front people experience number
different semi-abstract sensory phenomena Call Aura. Okay. That’s
Aura originates now. Photophobia little bit different photophobia. Now understand
beautiful work done Cliff saper's Lab Harvard Medical School
Laboratories showing photophobia originates specific set
neurons eye. call intrinsically photosensitive melanops ganglion
cells, really just mouthful nerd, speak neurons eye connect
brain, so-called ganglion cells respond robustly bright blue light
shortwavelength light. got short wavelength light blue greens short
wavelengths, long wavelet light, red know can even past
red will infrared. don't detect infrared consciously species like pit vipers can
see infrared can even heat sense. short wavelength light going light.
That’s That’s bright, blue, green, it’s common fluorescent bulbs
commonly used household lighting workplace lighting forms artificial
lighting. It’s also, course, present sunlight. Sunlight includes huge range
wavelengths, including long wavelength, light. course, seen Reds


oranges sunset on, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
eye respond best bright, green blue light, send connections bunch
different places brain, including so-called Central circadian clock superchiasmatic
nucleus, sets day night sleep wake rhythms. encourage people
view sunlight morning set system motion avoid bright light exposure
night artificial sources order not send wake-up signals eye brain
rest Body, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells also known connect areas brain. Many areas brain,
fact, one important areas brain connect relates
photophobia, area structure called thalamus. thalamus egg-like
structure sits center brain serves kind switchboard like
sensory relay information coming eyes ears Touch
system Etc funneled different compartments. thalamus sent
different areas brain, think kind like old-fashioned, switchboard
um, think it. Uh sort like airport. go uh particular um wing
airport. go particular gate on, getting funneled progressively
uh narrower narrower channels arrive particular plane much
way, thalamus bunch different entry points, it’s sensory information
coming bunch different sources sources get routed progressively
narrower narrower funnels eventually arrive accurate place function.
intrinsically photosensitive gangling cells send connections small important
area thalamus called LP. It’s denoted, L, letter P lateral, posterior
thalamus, say it’s lateral posterior nucleus thalamus uficionados
there, neurons location going respond. going
activated bright blue light, green light kind bright light originating artificial
sources sunlight neurons respond interesting
pattern connections. send connections so-called sensory cortex,
bunch different layers throughout cortex not associated visual perception.
not associated understanding shapes Contours
environment, rather neurons involved detection pressure, pain
forms sensory information level meninges talked
meninges earlier. again, brain not sensory system detect
pain, tissues around tissues around tissues, stuff around
meninges themselves, can respond pain intracranial. Pressure also relayed
meninges conscious awareness pain. mean
photophobia? means bright, blue light green light and, course, light


sunlight. activate neurons eye, intrinsically photosensitive ganglion
cells, activate lateral posterior, neurons, LP neurons LP neurons,
communicate areas brain specifically tuned different sensory
phenomena and, particular, pain level meninges intracranial pressure,
means headache simply photophobia
own, bright light actually trigger pain, sensing even creation pain
level meninges intracranial pressure. mean terms dealing
treating photophobia? Well, people deal photophobia deciding turn off
dim lights simply getting covers wearing um low, brim hat
putting sunglasses, want lie sometimes uh migraine
can associated Nausea even vomiting, it’s severe instances rather, one
simple way avoid activation retinal ganglion cells trigger
photophobia starting feel like migraine coming
photophobia coming shift using patterns light longer wavelength
domain, means practically Shifting using orange, ideally dim,
orange red light. Now. not call people go invest expensive red
light therapies. Admittedly, excellent case uses red light therapy,
particularly acne wound healing, even improving Vision, especially people beyond
age 40 hormone augmentation. talked episode
light health again, can find Hubermanlab.com everything time
stamped. talking simply red light bulbs hand
time need remain awake you're, starting experience. Photophobia
red light bulbs can purchased expensively. know, party lights,
can buy online, no specific need get uh. say red light. That’s
designed specifically photophobia anything sort can find cheapest um red
light available will simply work idea many people
experiencing photophobia, want reduce feeling pain pressure
head. Experience photophobia, also might want stay awake, get work
done things operating red light, or, say, living working, Etc
red light, allow stay awake, not hide covers,
experiencing photophobia addition - mentioned beginning episode -
many people find photophobia entry point trigger headache,
happens? start experience Aura, onset photophobia,
photophobia leads feeling malaise converts headache? so,
not lot clinical data just yet emerging idea realm
headache treatment idea can offset early signs, can offset


photophobia aura, perhaps Use dim red lights red lights,
described moment ago, might able reduce probability going
migraine type headache entirely. again, no need expensive red
lights, can find red lights easily online simply hand replace
current lights nightstand whatever room happen
red lights, red Lights also, mention useful limiting
amount cortisol, stress hormone healthy us release high levels early
day, fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels. It’s another reason why?
say relevant photophobia, want keep cortisol levels low
evening night, indeed improve transition sleep, indeed
sleep overall, reducing cortisol evening time night time Extremely beneficial
red lights will help accomplish that. talked episode light
health. point suffer photophobia without aura, using red
lights not simply dimming ordinary artificial lights feeling turn off,
lights entirely going one relatively inexpensive or, say, Inexpensive
cases, red lights can found inexpensively online way able
continue daily activities

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way
don't just episodes sleep master sleep, perfect, sleep, Etc.

access. don't even sign up, although like sign future
newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not
surface it’s not tension, headache, it’s not even cluster type headache
nerve activation trigeminal. It’s actually hyper constriction vasculature
brain caused ingestion pepper inflammatory response, remember
heat spicy go together neural Pathways bunch different heat related
spice related Pathways. Get activated simultaneously one ingests, something
extreme spice blood vessels, indeed smaller arteries feeding neural
tissue shut down, experienced Thunderclap headache, brutal
headache sadly, case, um permanent brain damage. So, loss neuronal tissue
neuronal tissue metabolically active. cut off blood supply
tissue. Not feel miserable, maybe even pass out, lose vision certain
brain areas will actually die off absence blood flow areas. know
commonly stroke, don't want strike fear anybody eating know,
jalapeno even spicy meal time time. not somebody
familiar eating spicy foods, certainly don't want enter one
competitions just realize pathways Menthol cool spicy hot
aren't just subjective Pathways. actually neural Pathways originate
so-called nerds call sensory epithelium, skin, hearing, eyes
feed information body make use information. case motor
movement, sensory motor. cases, information can fed nerve
Pathways goes vasculature causes vasculature either dilate constrict
spicy peppers, causing, just mentioned, extreme cerebro head
vasoconstriction brain damage. Again, That’s not going common thing there,
nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great
results seen non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Again, want highlight
none approaches necessarily designed done
replacement prescription drugs. physician, excellent prescription
drugs physician can prescribe treatment headache.
Nonetheless, think many people listeners podcast interested
things can order inoculate themselves, least reduce likelihood
experiencing headache, especially people experiencing chronic

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way

newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not
surface it’s not tension, headache, it’s not even cluster type headache
nerve activation trigeminal. It’s actually hyper constriction vasculature

many people find photophobia entry point trigger headache,
happens? start experience Aura, onset photophobia,
photophobia leads feeling malaise converts headache? so,
not lot clinical data just yet emerging idea realm

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known
make people feel little bit sleepy can enhance sleep well. Apogenic high
concentration can indeed augment sleep. talk this. sleep tool kit, way

newsletters, can get one key components toolkit sleep. addition
behavioral tools things not supplement, based apogenin,
component chamomile. idea certain herbal derivatives herbs Oils
useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not
surface it’s not tension, headache, it’s not even cluster type headache
nerve activation trigeminal. It’s actually hyper constriction vasculature
brain caused ingestion pepper inflammatory response, remember
heat spicy go together neural Pathways bunch different heat related
spice related Pathways. Get activated simultaneously one ingests, something
extreme spice blood vessels, indeed smaller arteries feeding neural
tissue shut down, experienced Thunderclap headache, brutal
headache sadly, case, um permanent brain damage. So, loss neuronal tissue
neuronal tissue metabolically active. cut off blood supply
tissue. Not feel miserable, maybe even pass out, lose vision certain
brain areas will actually die off absence blood flow areas. know
commonly stroke, don't want strike fear anybody eating know,
jalapeno even spicy meal time time. not somebody
familiar eating spicy foods, certainly don't want enter one
competitions just realize pathways Menthol cool spicy hot
aren't just subjective Pathways. actually neural Pathways originate
so-called nerds call sensory epithelium, skin, hearing, eyes
feed information body make use information. case motor
movement, sensory motor. cases, information can fed nerve
Pathways goes vasculature causes vasculature either dilate constrict
spicy peppers, causing, just mentioned, extreme cerebro head
vasoconstriction brain damage. Again, That’s not going common thing there,
nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great
results seen non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Again, want highlight
none approaches necessarily designed done
replacement prescription drugs. physician, excellent prescription
drugs physician can prescribe treatment headache.
Nonetheless, think many people listeners podcast interested
things can order inoculate themselves, least reduce likelihood
experiencing headache, especially people experiencing chronic

01:44:15 Tool: Tension Headache & Botox Treatment

Least, indoor environment, suffering photophobia, shifting back
ways reduce intensity frequency different kinds headaches, haven't talked
much tension headaches specifically. That’s like now recall
tension? Headaches going muscular origin again, keeping mind
everything's neural comes pain, everything's normal comes everything.
Frankly, every organ tissue system body ultimately controlled
nervous system. tension. Headaches often associated tension muscles
skull jaw neck can quite painful many people
debilitating, common treatment people rely is,
take non-steroid anti-inflammatory. things like acetaminophen ibuprofen, sometimes
aspirin things sort oftentimes can helpful. couple things
keep mind, however. NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
work well first, people quickly develop tolerance them, meaning going
take order get effect oftentimes. can't
take hard liver addition that,


can offset things really want. So, instance, it’s now
known non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset benefits exercise,
makes sense, lot Adaptive benefits exercise actually come
experiencing lot inflammation acute. means actually want inflammation
resistance, training, workout even endurance workout, inflammation
triggers adaptation event series adaptation. Events leads Greater strength,
greater speed, muscle, endurance whatever happen training,
reducing pain can good, course, not take
given drug side effects liver can offset effects exercise
forth, issue non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs many simply
not work many people work, first time second time,
stop working. also tend lower body temperature. think people aware
this, many drugs used order reduce fever.
taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply reduce headache lowing
core body temperature can sorts Downstream issues related sleep, wake
Cycles metabolism immune system function generally on.
reason, quite lot exploration alternatives non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, treatment headache indeed pain generally, today talking
headache now, relates Tension Headache, one advanced kind
modern treatments Sometimes hear Botox right Botox. think people
familiar thing people get injected face around eyes
around lips elsewhere. order quote unquote, reduce wrinkles. discovered
years ago Botox treatments done cosmetic reasons,
often effective relieving headache injected muscles way
works that, course, Tension. Headache involves tension muscles, kind
call clinching cinching muscles. really talking
contraction muscles That’s controlled neurons neurons,
neuromuscular neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses connections
neurons. form synapses muscle release acetylcholine onto muscle,
makes muscle contract. way move limbs body.
also way muscles head contract can give tension, type headaches.
Botox arises rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin toxin. That’s
found canned goods, not canned goods, course, it. prevents
certain step release so-called neurotransmitter little packets live in,
called vesicles little little spheres neurotransmitter live end neuron
nerve Terminals released onto muscle, make muscle contract botulinum


neurotoxin Cleaves. particular protein aficionados, want look
up. It’s really cool mechanism. Cleaves something called Snap 25.. Snap 25 involved
fusion little spheres, membrane neuron releasing
neurotransmitter. botulinum neurotoxin present nerve muscle interface,
nerves cannot communicate muscle and, consequence, muscles
undergo kind flaccid tone. just kind relax underneath skin sure wrinkles
relieved, Botox injected muscles themselves, can provide long-lasting
relief certain types headaches, particular tension type headaches. seems
like bit extreme treatment, people suffer badly tension type headaches
due hyper contraction muscles forehead around temples around
Jaws certain parts neck Musc muscles neck encroach
back skull actually connect back skull can achieve
tremendous long, lasting relief Botox injections, sometimes weeks months
even longer, people go periodic uh. know re-ups Botox. actually quite
safe, despite fact botulinum neurotoxin quite dangerous. It’s given low
Doses given locally, muscles affected. That’s Botox
used

01:49:43 Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol

Treat headaches um it’s effective treatment that. course, many people
imagine - interested not just drug based treatments not Botox type treatments
treating headache types treatments headache so,
call natural um non-drug treatments, starting get realm
kind herbal oil-based treatments headache now confess first started
researching area headache treatment headaches. um. found
approaching bit trepidation, started hear essential oils
herbal medications things sort, thought okay well, there'll probably
effects. mean. Admittedly, talked podcast things like
apogenin epigenin one core components chamomile chamomile known

useful improving symptoms whatever. case, improving sleep
apogenin not unheard fact data continued released time
many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great
results seen non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Again, want highlight
none approaches necessarily designed done
replacement prescription drugs. physician, excellent prescription
drugs physician can prescribe treatment headache.
Nonetheless, think many people listeners podcast interested
things can order inoculate themselves, least reduce likelihood
experiencing headache, especially people experiencing chronic

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches
traumatic, brain injury related headaches. talked different types treatments
ranging creatine omega-3, fatty acid, supplementation, herbal indeed
essential oil treatments well acupuncture, shown
significant impact reducing frequency intensity headaches many cases,
Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal

particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin

many things think herbal Etc can actually quite potent effects
um. approaching discussion essential oils um,
say, oils right say, essential not oils herbs treatment
headache, finished research literature feeling um. Quite say uh,
surprised um need really check bit, found
certain herbs oils, instance, far outperform non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs treatment headache. That’s right. certain oils
available counter that, looked many studies, meta-analyzes tell
one particular study meta-analysis. moment, show can
reduce frequency intensity headache manner far outpaces
observe non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs apparently none issues
associated non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. think it’s really worth paying
attention first studies. like describe one now become
kind classic literature. say, least interested
atypical treatments headache, title paper effective: peppermint
eucalyptus oil preparations neurophysiological experimental alge's metric headache
parameters. Okay, mean? Well? interesting study because, rather
look effectiveness peppermint eucalyptus oil oils headache,
want look mechanisms underlying headache
confess love fact want understand Neurophysiology not just get
subjective ratings headache, although too, really want understand
oils can impact things like muscular tension perception pain.
recreated headache human subjects using tightening cuffs head,
cut off blood supply certain areas head. basically induced headache,
measured things like EMG, muscle response level electrophysiology
muscle and, course, subjective measures much people perceive pain
not pain. give broad Contour study, want make sure
it’s conclusions come clearly will provide link study
show, note captions. people use one four different
preparations say preparation, one includes peppermint oil eucalyptus


oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension

oil details amount relative percentages paper
peruse online link. mentioned four different groups.
one group apply peppermint oil, peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
another group used just peppermint oil. another group use, just tiny
traces peppermint oil smaller doses eucalyptus oil, fourth
group just using Placebo. say using
sponge, applying oil temples forehead people
used different approaches measure activation muscles measure pain
induced head pain. induced headache so, looked temporal
muscles side. looked forehead muscles things sort, used three
different types pain stimuli. looked people's sensitivity experimentally, induced
Pain either providing pressure. kind cuff around forehead thermal
pain, actually them. Basically, heat heat level skin actually
brought heat pretty high point people rating, pain almost
point um excessive pain pain limits. obviously couldn't take
point extreme pain constriction type condition cut off
blood circulation pericranial muscles, using inflatable collar around cranium
inflated pretty high pressure kind Brutal experiment involved
look trying mimic headache think using different approaches,
able mimic different aspects headache make sure key point
every person study not just getting treatment headache, getting
headache That’s something think gives study power. It’s not
way study like this, gives lot power trying understand types
interventions going assist headache maybe even specific dimensions
pain headache basically found study treatments
used, essential plant oil preparations contained peppermint just mention
aside studies Menthol. minty type uh essential minty type um,
think flavors, really Aromas well point mechanism.
moment effect significantly reducing intensity pain.
subjects tolerate pain, far better experienced less pain, subjectively
magnitude effects really pretty impressive. went thinking
essential oils. Okay, That’s like really woo stuff um. know don't know that,
turns essential oils, least ones contain peppermint oil
without eucalyptus oil performed well reducing pain. key takeaway study
- paraphrasing study - combination peppermint oil
eucalyptus oil, basically ethanol suspension. Again, people not


drinking essential oils. want clear. applying
skin around area, That’s pain particularly temple foreheads increased
cognitive performance. didn't talk that, ability maintain cognitive
functioning pain. know talking headache now, just
kind pain, pain can debilitating ability work perform
things. combination peppermint oil eucalyptus oil applied skin,
allow people increase cognitive performance pain
muscle, relaxing mentally relaxing effect. Mental relaxation was, course, measured
subjectively, remember one things led feature study episode
particular, didn't just say: oh muscles feel relaxed. actually saw
muscles forehead temples surrounding muscles
relaxed people oils applied forehead temples, not
perhaps degree one observe botox extent
Duration, one experience botox, much way, raises
question going mean: placebo effect? Well, no,
compared Placebo controlled odor, course, oil.
applied everyone thought getting essentially thing pun
intended. case, found applied essential oil
forehead temples people experience less cooling sensation
feel something happening underlying muscle. Well,
happening. now know Menthol peppermint things smell way
taste way actually impact sensory neurons level skin
can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons can activate Sensory neurons. Okay.
So, order understand this, go back said beginning
episode, motor neurons. neurons constrict muscles
excuse cause contraction muscles strict them. cause contraction muscles.
Sensory neurons, sense different things, light sound touch,
modulatory neurons, Menthol Eucalyptus actually known activate certain channels
sensory neurons respond not just touch, also sensation cooling. Okay.
think Menthol peppermint, think kind cool scents flavors
cool, meaning cold think things like hot peppers capsaicin, think
anything hot temperature. tend think spicy, spicy hot go together
peppermint menthol cool go together much way gum
commercials mint commercials lead believe, fact right
happening here. application oils likely activating channels
sensory neurons, including trip channels, others well leading


analges effect shutting heat pain Pathways heat pain,
not exactly same? nervous system, funneled common
Pathways, whereas Cooling Pain Relief funneled alternate call
parallel Pathways. study peppermint eucalyptus oil preparations reducing
pain headache different aspects pain due headache, think, really important
don't just illustrate fact yes, indeed - know going record
saying That’s data Say - papers support
statement well, essential oils applied skin can reduce symptoms tension,
headache significant way actually can lead offset cognitive
defects seen headaches. That’s impressive. must say surprising,
kind put place somebody thought. Oh essential oils going like okay,
it’s actually seemed um, really hold Merit compare magnitude
effect, even though enormous number subjects, compare
magnet effect paper like similar papers essential oils
impact non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs really hold and,
cases, exceed positive impact anti-inflammatory drugs. reason think
can look peppermint oils peppermint Eucalyptus containing oils. Menthol
containing oils applied skin treatment

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture
maps different insertion sites, now know - say, people long known
people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience
pain, reduced inflammation and, many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory
Pathways. just want sure mention acupuncture little bit mechanistic
understanding acupuncture works, indeed, acupuncture shown quite
effective treatment tension



02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron
damask Rose chamomile lavender bunch things, not going go
every one lot detail. tended today, going
now - highlight potent different treatments again: Menthol peppermint
oil among potent addition particular pathway, That’s
associated headache, say Mean different types headache


includes activation thing, call cgrp cgrp again, involved calcium
regulation pathway leads vasodilation vessels arteries capillaries
way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
suddenly experience called Thunderclap headache. Thunderclap headache
unique type headache, different types headaches. not

nonetheless encourage people cautious Carolina Reaper. today
talked headaches first highlighted different types headache. Making
clear understanding headache might experiencing can beneficial


understanding sorts treatments best perhaps also best avoided
trying alleviate headaches prevent happening all. talked
tension headaches, migraine, headaches, hormone-based, headaches, cluster headaches

Reductions frequency intensity headaches least great

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms

02:01:35 Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment & Acupuncture

Tension type headache um among potent treatments available now
another way approach treatment tension. Headache something many
probably heard before, talked little bit podcast
previous episodes That’s acupuncture. will entire episode
acupuncture, much way essential oils. think many people, not all,
many people considered kind woo biology people. Think
alternative medicine. Keep mind that, underlying mechanisms things like
peppermint oils starting discovered Omega-3s starting discovered,
mechanistically, hold well, logic underlying
understanding not just work, Many cases work
way acupuncture, course existed thousands years, used
successfully treat headache forms pain. much many
insurance companies will now pay acupuncture insured practice. Not all, many
will addition that, scientific Community starting understand mechanistically


acupuncture works. don't want make major Focus now,
briefly, laboratory Harvard Medical School run chufuma. Chufu well known
Neuroscience Community excellent work parsing mechanisms touch
sensation pain particular, not just touch level skin pain pain
Pathways, recent years laboratory started studies acupuncture
works, because, indeed, acupuncture known work alleviate pain long
time, underlying mechanisms haven't clear. chufu's lab published
now excellent journals like nature science journals, precise insertion
sites different needles lead activation sensory neurons Downstream
Pathways ways can potently reduce inflammation can used potently
reduce activity certain muscles, instance, muscles forehead temples,
hear acupuncture can reduce pain. think people think oh well,
needles sticking face. First all, must hurt, actually needles
fine. Needles skilled acupuncturists can insert without pain actually
person receiving. doesn't even usually recognize needles That’s quickly
efficiently can put in, people don't detect pain,
shown greatly reduce pain, particular headache, related pain back-related pain
forms pain. Chufu'S lab shown specific needle insertion sites can
activate sensory Pathways can deactivate sensory motor pathways now
familiar Sensory, neurons, motor neurons modulatory neurons can
modulate activity pain Pathways. way impacting activity sorts
different organs, including organs give rise inflammatory cytokines.
basically, saying that, thanks thousands years acupuncture

people west starting adopt understanding acupuncture. Yes, indeed,
really work relieving pain Laboratories. United States,
chufus elsewhere starting find underlying mechanisms,
mechanisms include deactivation pain Pathways activation parallel
Pathways assist shutting pain relaxing muscles causing
tension. Type headache, well activation neural Pathways, impinge organs
cause reduce release molecules body give us experience

side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light

transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different

including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective

interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number

uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount

bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell

however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going

fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent

curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily

dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin

curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms

02:05:41 Tool: Migraine & Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing

Type headache and, extent migraine headache well, talked omega-
3 fatty acids. talked essential oils, talked acupuncture, episode
starting sound, like alternative treatments, headache, including migraine, want
clear. not alternative treatments. Everything talking
mechanistic basis, talking today approaches dealing
headache that, yes, typically over-the-counter compounds grounded nutrition
case acupuncture behavioral practices, not necessarily meant
replacements. things like non-steroid, inflammatory drugs prescription drugs,
course, things can still taken. Many people derive benefit them, goal
always. believe hope people find ways can control health
outcomes reduce things. Like headache, using minimum number things
side effects, that, course, can also include use essential oils
conjunction things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory, drugs use red light
offset photophobia conjunction number different Treatments either prescription
otherwise. want make clear, especially want make clear,
transition next segment, going tell herbal treatments
migraine, based consider comprehensive review many
randomized Control studies - indeed, title paper - herbal treatments migraine,
systematic review randomized, controlled studies, published 2020,
contains immense amount information. will provide link
really want dive deep this. paper, focus number different
reviews Analysis data focused compounds treatment migraine, ranging
including things like Menthol peppermint oil. already covered that.
won't cover detail, review highlight results refer
plus results show Menthol peppermint oil can quite effective
treatment tension, type headache and, case migraine headache well. That’s
interesting Menthol peppermint oils can used not just treat tension, type
headaches, migraine headaches well, look enormous number
types herbal essential oil type treatments. Everything coriander Citron

way can create pain. feeling pressure. Inside head, can
uncomfortable course now earlier episode mentioned, going touch
caffeine, going now now. reason mention caffeine
sort lore that, headache drinking cup coffee, can eliminate
headache. things point. First all, somebody ingests
caffeine every day - not ingest caffeine, will indeed get headache
drinking caffeine will relieve particular headache. it’s absolutely true caffeine can
relieve lack caffeine induced headache. That’s sort duh, leads actually
important question, is: case? Well, turns
caffeine vasodilator vasoconstrictor. that? Well, one
main ways caffeine makes us alert occupies receptors
something called adenosine. Adenosine molecule builds brain body
more, longer awake, it’s one things makes us feel
sleepy. drink caffeine, caffeine occupies adenosine receptor
adenosine cannot normal effect making us sleepy. caffeine wears off
adenosine combine feel sleepy adenosine vasodilator. drink
caffeine blocks effects adenosine, vasoconstriction associated
drinking caffeine. headache associated excessive
vasodilation pressure head, indeed drinking caffeine can cause
vasoconstriction preventing adenosine pathway. normally lead
vasoconstriction can get relief headache. However, caffeine also
vasodilator caffeine ability impinge so-called no pathway, nitric oxide
pathway, nerve blood pathway involves different enzymes
won't get right now, maybe future episode causes Dilation blood
vessels and, consequence, drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation. it’s sort
two-pronged effect. Now one ways might think
perhaps utilize. well rested it’s early day
sleep, previous night adenosine levels likely low, especially
slept well night conditions, ingest caffeine, Not
going experience vasoconstriction effects caffeine, ordinarily
inhibiting adenosine. Why? adenosine not present
conditions, drinking coffee lead vasodilation, not lot nonetheless
vasodilation. If, however, haven't slept well it’s late day
long time, drinking caffeine likely vasoconstriction effect,


important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

important treatments hear involve using caffeine
Treat headache Extreme okay headache night, drink cup
coffee go sleep. actually saw literature couldn't quite believe
because, yes, indeed, people can fall asleep drinking caffeine, know
well thanks beautiful work science Communications people like Dr Matthew,
Walker University California, Berkeley guest many
podcasts that, even can fall asleep drinking caffeine, ingesting caffeine
within 10 12 hours prior bedtime simply not good idea ways
disrupts architecture sleep. So, takeaway caffeine headache
vasodil relation, need clear whether not caffeine tends remove
headache exacerbate it. Now going depend time day amount
adenosine system. mentioned before, also, seems kind
bimodal distribution whereby people, drink caffeine, really improves
headache so, cases, significant effects, whereas people,
drink caffeine, really exacerbates headache and, least far tell
literature, it’s not easy predict people going be. reassuring,
however, is. not seem case that, somebody experiences relief
headaches drinking caffeine suddenly one day next going
experience worsening headache - vice versa also true.
somebody drinks, caffeine headaches get worse, don't think
reason think caffeine, one day one day next rather going somehow
alleviate headache. determine whether not headaches
relieved exacerbated drinking caffeine wondering it’s confusing
it’s caffeine hits

02:13:26 Tool: Migraine Treatments & Curcumin (Turmeric)

Vasodilation vasoconstriction Pathways nothing anyone else
can now. last thing like talk terms relief headaches
something guessing about. Probably 25 percent familiar with, 75
percent not, curcumin. Curcumin often also referred turmeric
turmeric root, curcumin one key components root. Curcumin
known potent anti-inflammatory properties. don't think That’s debated all.
fact, it’s potent anti-inflammatory people cautioned taking
high levels curcumin prior to, instance, resistance, training, workouts even


cardiovascular workouts, prevents inflammation also can prevent
adaptation response. remember inflammation occurs exercise
resistance cardiovascular exercise is, least part, trigger adaptation
it’s going lead enhanced endurance, enhanced strength, hypertrophy, Etc. Nonetheless,
curcumin explored context treatment migraine it’s one
compounds analyzed extensive detail wonderful review mentioned
little bit earlier. like study able explore effects
curcumin explored previous research studies compare across large range
different dosages large range combinations things like coenzyme Q10,
talked podcast before, think sake discussion, just
really focusing curcumin alone conjunction omega-3 fatty acids,
turns interesting. First all, curcumin shown
generally safe people dosages high 8, 000 milligrams per day eight
grams per day. Now want clear. not recommend anyone take dosages
curcumin, AKA turmeric high. well curcumin turmeric not
anti-inflammatory, also can impinge Pathways, particular hormonal
Pathways fact, curcumin AKA turmeric can alter synthesis something called
dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone involved enormous range different bodily
functions. It’s involved libido, it’s involved Men, beard, growth regulation
number different tissues, reproductive axis outside reproductive axis
curcumin potent inhibitor DHT. want caution people take high
doses curcumin people sensitive curcumin will even low
doses, experience reductions DHT lead things not like,
sufficient reductions libido. However, curcumin shown effective anti-
inflammatory shown effective treating different types headache
particular migraine headache. One ways curcumin inhibit
thing talked minutes ago, nitric oxide no, causes
vasodilation that, can reduce feeling one lot intracranial
pressure. Okay, curcumin dosages come enormous range, mentioned before,
dosages range anywhere 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day taken
eight weeks time. That’s examined. It’s explored 80, milligram dosages
taken alongside two half grams omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids alone,
Placebo, general conclusion studies curcumin
taken dosages 80 milligrams. Although sensitive
curcumin, probably low 25 even 50 milligrams per day, conjunction with, although
not necessarily time, taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids two


half grams per day, led significant improvements. migraine forms
headache, meaning frequency intensity headaches occurred
greatly reduced. One important point curcumin keep mind curcumin
known inhibit something called cytochrome p450, That’s associated enzymatic
pathway things relate blood coagulation, people taking
medications anticoagulants prevent clotting. need cautious
using curcumin and, course, curcumin supplement

02:18:00 Carolina Reaper Pepper & Thunderclap Headache

always talk doctor prior including removing supplement
regimen? So, can see, number different things that, addition
prescription drugs over-the-counter pain, medications, things like non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs can really impact different aspects headache different types
headache cases differentially now today, talked mainly tension, type
migraine type headaches, common forms headache.
are, course, cluster type headaches neural origin talked hormonal
headaches indeed, treatments Omega-3s, shown
beneficial offsetting. menstrual related headaches now, context
discussion Omega-3s, keep mind Omega-3s can obtained
supplementation nutrition. don't necessarily take omega-3 capsules
liquid form Omega-3s. want use Omega-3s Target different symptoms
headache, probably going efficient way it, given many
foods contain Omega threes. it’s hard get one gram dosage fact,
studies talked today involved getting two even two half
cases podcast previous guests Dr Rhonda Patrick. talked
advantages getting high three grams Omega-3s per day, almost
certainty going require external form supplementation, even
making point eat fatty ocean fish skin on. just want make
sure highlight wrap up. can't help talk something
heard news several years ago, sounded outrageous true,
confirmed accurate one neurologist colleagues. That’s fact
eating certain spicy peppers can induce headache cases, can induce brain
damage bear here. not talking traditional jalapeno
acknowledging fact certain people can tolerate far spicy taste case.


others, people sensitive spicy. people can tolerate spicy food
one can build tolerance spicy food ingesting progressively spicy
excuse me, spicy spicier Foods time. Nonetheless, Pepper
eating contests um, not common, exist people challenge
eat peppers um, extreme spiciness one particular. That’s
referred Carolina Reaper. way, That’s not person, far know, That’s
pepper, Carolina Reaper, known potent spice pepper
not want eat Carolina Reaper years ago. one
Pepper eating contests, man ate Carolina Reaper part competition
