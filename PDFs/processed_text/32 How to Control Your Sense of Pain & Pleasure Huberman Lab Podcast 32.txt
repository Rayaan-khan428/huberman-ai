00:12:04 Pleasure & Pain, & Skin Sensors

year supply vitamin D3K2. talk pleasure pain. think
intuitively understand pleasure pain are. Pleasure generally sensation
body mind leads us pursue whatever bringing
sensation. pain also sensation body mind general leads
us want withdraw move away activity interaction. not always
case. people actively seek pain. people somehow can't seem
engage experience pleasure, people operate basis pleasure
pain. Scientists call appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors lead us


create appetite behaviors aversive behaviors, behaviors
make us want move away something. simplest example
putting hand near hot flame, point, reflex deep
desire withdraw hand. Tasting something delicious general makes us want
eat thing. Interactions people find delicious, also make us
want interact people more. None complicated sophisticated.
simply illustrate fact pleasure pain tend evoke opposite
responses, opposite behavioral responses opposite emotional responses.
come about? Well, really comes interaction starts one
end body, meaning skin end organs body,
deep within brain. consider two ends spectrum pleasure
pain contribute experiences pleasure pain. organ
call skin, mentioned earlier, largest organ body. throughout
organ, neurons, little nerve cells. Now really technical it,
way like understand so-called cell body meaning location
cell DNA goodies kind central factory cell,
actually sits right outside spinal cord. spinal cord either
side little blobs neurons, little collections neurons. name
like know aficionado curious, called DRGs
dorsal root ganglia. ganglion just collection clump cells. DRGs
really interesting send one branch call axon, little wire
skin, also muscles organs, talking skin.
send wire skin wire literally reaches skin. actually
skin another wire cell body goes opposite
direction, brain creates connections within brain so-
called brainstem. means neuron body call DRG
sends wire axon sense going big toe sends
another axon opposite direction base brain, largest cell
entire body kind. Fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera. extremely
long cells. can meter depending tall happen be.
cells wires go off two different directions wire
within skin will respond number different categories stimuli. wires
positioned within skin respond mechanical forces. maybe light touch,
will send electrical activity toward brain response light touch.


Meaning press skin really hard, don't respond. stroke skin
lightly fingertips feather respond robustly. Others respond
course pressure, hard pressure, won't respond light feather,
instance. Others respond temperature. will respond presence heat
presence cold changes heat cold. still others respond types
stimuli, like certain chemicals skin. Many probably experienced
sensation eating hot pepper. Well, don't recommend this,
take little slice jalapeno hot pepper, habanero pepper something like
rub skin, actually feel something location.
pepper doesn't just create sensation within mouth, will create
similar sensation skin. neurons amazing. collecting
information particular kinds skin throughout entire body sending
information toward brain. really incredible, just want ponder
second. really incredible language neurons use
exactly same. neuron responds light touch sends electrical signals
toward brain, neurons respond cold heat habanero pepper,
respond particular thing evokes electrical response. say
respond particular stimulus, pepper, cold, heat, et cetera,
will evoke electrical signal, electrical signals common language
neurons use. yet, something cold presented skin, like ice cube, even
don't see ice cube, eyes closed, someone comes behind
puts ice cube bare skin back, know sensation,
thing cold.

perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density

another feature way built way experience pleasure

body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring

herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get

00:28:11 Thoughts & Genes Make Physical Pain Worse

sudden rash inflammation one location, dermatome, can ask
make hurt? make worse? make go away?
believe not, subjective interpretation happening profound

now number solid experiments, animal models humans point
fact know painful stimulus coming, can better prepare

anticipation occurs vital happen. timing isn't quite right,
actually can make experience pain far worse. summarizing large

vitally important treatment pain pain not event skin.
Pain subjective, emotional experience. may heard

Nociceptor comes word noci, nocere believe is, means harm.
However, nociceptors don't carry information pain, carry information

necessarily mean think, oh, person pain irrelevant, probably not.
fact, high threshold pain, someone comes says, extreme
pain, doctor probably thinks, wow, really, really extreme, can
talking two different experiences. Similarly, physician low

biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative

severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went

completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even

extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers

so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab

say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged

somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

00:12:04 Pleasure & Pain, & Skin Sensors

year supply vitamin D3K2. talk pleasure pain. think
intuitively understand pleasure pain are. Pleasure generally sensation
body mind leads us pursue whatever bringing
sensation. pain also sensation body mind general leads
us want withdraw move away activity interaction. not always
case. people actively seek pain. people somehow can't seem
engage experience pleasure, people operate basis pleasure
pain. Scientists call appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors lead us


create appetite behaviors aversive behaviors, behaviors
make us want move away something. simplest example
putting hand near hot flame, point, reflex deep
desire withdraw hand. Tasting something delicious general makes us want
eat thing. Interactions people find delicious, also make us
want interact people more. None complicated sophisticated.
simply illustrate fact pleasure pain tend evoke opposite
responses, opposite behavioral responses opposite emotional responses.
come about? Well, really comes interaction starts one
end body, meaning skin end organs body,
deep within brain. consider two ends spectrum pleasure
pain contribute experiences pleasure pain. organ
call skin, mentioned earlier, largest organ body. throughout
organ, neurons, little nerve cells. Now really technical it,
way like understand so-called cell body meaning location
cell DNA goodies kind central factory cell,
actually sits right outside spinal cord. spinal cord either
side little blobs neurons, little collections neurons. name
like know aficionado curious, called DRGs
dorsal root ganglia. ganglion just collection clump cells. DRGs
really interesting send one branch call axon, little wire
skin, also muscles organs, talking skin.
send wire skin wire literally reaches skin. actually
skin another wire cell body goes opposite
direction, brain creates connections within brain so-
called brainstem. means neuron body call DRG
sends wire axon sense going big toe sends
another axon opposite direction base brain, largest cell
entire body kind. Fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera. extremely
long cells. can meter depending tall happen be.
cells wires go off two different directions wire
within skin will respond number different categories stimuli. wires
positioned within skin respond mechanical forces. maybe light touch,
will send electrical activity toward brain response light touch.


Meaning press skin really hard, don't respond. stroke skin
lightly fingertips feather respond robustly. Others respond
course pressure, hard pressure, won't respond light feather,
instance. Others respond temperature. will respond presence heat
presence cold changes heat cold. still others respond types
stimuli, like certain chemicals skin. Many probably experienced
sensation eating hot pepper. Well, don't recommend this,
take little slice jalapeno hot pepper, habanero pepper something like
rub skin, actually feel something location.
pepper doesn't just create sensation within mouth, will create
similar sensation skin. neurons amazing. collecting
information particular kinds skin throughout entire body sending
information toward brain. really incredible, just want ponder
second. really incredible language neurons use
exactly same. neuron responds light touch sends electrical signals
toward brain, neurons respond cold heat habanero pepper,
respond particular thing evokes electrical response. say
respond particular stimulus, pepper, cold, heat, et cetera,
will evoke electrical signal, electrical signals common language
neurons use. yet, something cold presented skin, like ice cube, even
don't see ice cube, eyes closed, someone comes behind
puts ice cube bare skin back, know sensation,
thing cold.

don't misperceive heat habanero pepper. amazing.
means must another element equation creates pleasure
pain. element brain. brain takes electrical signals
interprets them. Partially based experience, also innate meaning
hard wired aspects pain pleasure sensing require no experience
whatsoever. child doesn't fall know first fall, hurt.
don't touch flame, first time will withdraw


hand flame. no prior experiences required. things prior experience
required. instance, somebody intense, intense aversion spicy
foods, probably tasted spicy foods before. Likewise, really
like sweet foods, probably tasted before. can start
make predictions based prior experience, pain pleasure system don't
need prior experience. need brain can interpret electrical

somatosensory cortex. portion neocortex, outside brain,
kind bumpy part, not kind normally formed brain, will bumpy.
smooth brain not good. animals just smooth brain.
Humans bumpy brain, means large surface area.
bumps 'cause squeezed like pizza clump bunched

00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes

go areas body. can actually experience real time right
now simple experiment call two-point discrimination. Two-points
discrimination ability know whether not two points pressure far apart,
near other, actually perceive incorrectly one point pressure.
might want second person experiment. it. will
close eyes, person take two fine points. Don't make sharp,
please. two pencils pens backs pens. Two pens holding

pilot, V5 V7, love. close eyes take
two pens put points close together centimeter apart present
top hand, going just going now myself. You, even
though eyes closed, able perceive two points
pressure presented simultaneously top hand. However,
middle back, not experience two points pressure.
experience one single point pressure. words, two
point discrimination better, higher areas body many, many
sensory receptors. sensitive locations. Now makes
perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density
receptors across body surface has. can go step describe
another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried
neighboring area body receiving input another nerve one
doesn't virus living it. anytime see rash pattern body

impacting dermatome. experienced not herpes simplex,
experience lot blood sort aggregating kind
segment across front face, really bizarre. looked mirror
thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines
face said, okay, rash reaction rather can happen here, not
region right next it. Whenever see chances reaction nerves


dermatome. start see things start look

just experience tingling even pleasant sensation, will restricted
kind strict boundary one location body surface not another. Not
corresponding organ like, okay, arm just feet something like that.
just segment. almost like someone outlined particular area body surface.

00:28:11 Thoughts & Genes Make Physical Pain Worse

dermatome. got sensors skin got brain
going interpret going sensors. fact, can take example
sudden rash inflammation one location, dermatome, can ask
make hurt? make worse? make go away?
believe not, subjective interpretation happening profound
influence experience pleasure pain. several things can
impact experiences, main categories expectation. sort whether
not thought expect thing going happen, right? someone
tells going hurt, going give injection right here, might hurt

low level arousal, autonomic arousal, going impact experience
pleasure pain. well slept so-called circadian 24-

can imagine daylight waking hours better able
tolerate, resilient pain, better able experience pleasure.
night threshold pain much lower. words, amount mechanical

last one genes. Pain threshold long pain response lasts
part dictated genes. later going discuss myth whether not
really myth whether not certain people particular red heads, people

just give little sneak peek that, indeed genetic


difference particular gene, particular pattern receptors skin

slept, so-called 24-hour circadian time genes.
talk expectation anxiety two factors can powerfully modulate
experience pleasure pain ways will allow us dial pleasure
like dial pain, indeed want do. talk
expectation anxiety two things somewhat tethered.
now number solid experiments, animal models humans point
fact know painful stimulus coming, can better prepare
mentally therefore buffer reduce pain response. However, timing
anticipation occurs vital happen. timing isn't quite right,
actually can make experience pain far worse. summarizing large
amount literature, essentially subjects warned painful stimulus

vitally important treatment pain pain not event skin.
Pain subjective, emotional experience. may heard

Nociceptor comes word noci, nocere believe is, means harm.
However, nociceptors don't carry information pain, carry information
particular types stimuli impacting skin. brain assigns value

painful painful varies. Now, physicians people physicians
treat pain, know lot data now someone comes clinic
says experiencing chronic pain whole body pain acute pain
injury one location, doesn't really matter cause even cause
all, doctor reacts report patient's pain will dictate many cases
course treatment. course doctors, goal treat patient going

found think now work done try change this,
doctor high threshold pain, interpretation somebody else's report
pain going different. might not discount patient, right? doesn't
necessarily mean think, oh, person pain irrelevant, probably not.
fact, high threshold pain, someone comes says, extreme
pain, doctor probably thinks, wow, really, really extreme, can
talking two different experiences. Similarly, physician low
threshold pain, someone comes says, yeah, experiencing pain
back. got sciatica thing, yeah, little bit uncomfortable. like a,
don't know like four 10. Well, physician might interpret four 10
pretty extreme sense pain pretty extreme experience pain. can
start see subjective nature pain can start real impact
treatment pain treatment pain carried physicians. fact,
no objective measure pain. can ask long somebody can keep hand

uncomfortable experiments can imagine, general, don't way
measuring somebody else's subjective experience pain. no blood pressure

efforts neuroscience medicine try come objective

good, love please less that, no way
gauging people experiencing except report language.
really just illustrate whole thing around pain isn't black box.
understanding elements. elements skin,

00:40:27 Protocol 2: Cold Sensing Relative; Getting Cold Water

can allow us better understand navigate axis call pleasure-

work athletes work military
work general public. one best tests somebody can handle

physical ability can just get cold. somehow able it. Now, don't
know experience cold is. neither you. know
experience, able that. quickly, slowly. Others find
experience cold aversive somehow cannot get in.
start quaking, start complaining many just simply get out.
can't it. don't even get past knees. isn't necessarily pain
threshold, related that. think can helpful everyone know even
though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water
warm body water colder, sometimes ocean, notice

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief

treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause

saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within

particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole

fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th

treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case

another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce

acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well

prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic

acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix

metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows

acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point

Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,

Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.

particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,

squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write

Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find

year supply vitamin D3K2. talk pleasure pain. think
intuitively understand pleasure pain are. Pleasure generally sensation
body mind leads us pursue whatever bringing
sensation. pain also sensation body mind general leads
us want withdraw move away activity interaction. not always
case. people actively seek pain. people somehow can't seem
engage experience pleasure, people operate basis pleasure
pain. Scientists call appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors lead us


create appetite behaviors aversive behaviors, behaviors
make us want move away something. simplest example
putting hand near hot flame, point, reflex deep
desire withdraw hand. Tasting something delicious general makes us want
eat thing. Interactions people find delicious, also make us
want interact people more. None complicated sophisticated.
simply illustrate fact pleasure pain tend evoke opposite
responses, opposite behavioral responses opposite emotional responses.
come about? Well, really comes interaction starts one
end body, meaning skin end organs body,
deep within brain. consider two ends spectrum pleasure
pain contribute experiences pleasure pain. organ
call skin, mentioned earlier, largest organ body. throughout
organ, neurons, little nerve cells. Now really technical it,
way like understand so-called cell body meaning location
cell DNA goodies kind central factory cell,
actually sits right outside spinal cord. spinal cord either
side little blobs neurons, little collections neurons. name
like know aficionado curious, called DRGs
dorsal root ganglia. ganglion just collection clump cells. DRGs
really interesting send one branch call axon, little wire
skin, also muscles organs, talking skin.
send wire skin wire literally reaches skin. actually
skin another wire cell body goes opposite
direction, brain creates connections within brain so-
called brainstem. means neuron body call DRG
sends wire axon sense going big toe sends
another axon opposite direction base brain, largest cell
entire body kind. Fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera. extremely
long cells. can meter depending tall happen be.
cells wires go off two different directions wire
within skin will respond number different categories stimuli. wires
positioned within skin respond mechanical forces. maybe light touch,
will send electrical activity toward brain response light touch.


Meaning press skin really hard, don't respond. stroke skin
lightly fingertips feather respond robustly. Others respond
course pressure, hard pressure, won't respond light feather,
instance. Others respond temperature. will respond presence heat
presence cold changes heat cold. still others respond types
stimuli, like certain chemicals skin. Many probably experienced
sensation eating hot pepper. Well, don't recommend this,
take little slice jalapeno hot pepper, habanero pepper something like
rub skin, actually feel something location.
pepper doesn't just create sensation within mouth, will create
similar sensation skin. neurons amazing. collecting
information particular kinds skin throughout entire body sending
information toward brain. really incredible, just want ponder
second. really incredible language neurons use
exactly same. neuron responds light touch sends electrical signals
toward brain, neurons respond cold heat habanero pepper,
respond particular thing evokes electrical response. say
respond particular stimulus, pepper, cold, heat, et cetera,
will evoke electrical signal, electrical signals common language
neurons use. yet, something cold presented skin, like ice cube, even
don't see ice cube, eyes closed, someone comes behind
puts ice cube bare skin back, know sensation,
thing cold.

00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes

go areas body. can actually experience real time right
now simple experiment call two-point discrimination. Two-points
discrimination ability know whether not two points pressure far apart,
near other, actually perceive incorrectly one point pressure.
might want second person experiment. it. will
close eyes, person take two fine points. Don't make sharp,
please. two pencils pens backs pens. Two pens holding

pilot, V5 V7, love. close eyes take
two pens put points close together centimeter apart present
top hand, going just going now myself. You, even
though eyes closed, able perceive two points
pressure presented simultaneously top hand. However,
middle back, not experience two points pressure.
experience one single point pressure. words, two
point discrimination better, higher areas body many, many
sensory receptors. sensitive locations. Now makes
perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density
receptors across body surface has. can go step describe
another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried
neighboring area body receiving input another nerve one
doesn't virus living it. anytime see rash pattern body

thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines

just experience tingling even pleasant sensation, will restricted
kind strict boundary one location body surface not another. Not

just segment. almost like someone outlined particular area body surface.

00:28:11 Thoughts & Genes Make Physical Pain Worse

dermatome. got sensors skin got brain
going interpret going sensors. fact, can take example
sudden rash inflammation one location, dermatome, can ask
make hurt? make worse? make go away?
believe not, subjective interpretation happening profound
influence experience pleasure pain. several things can
impact experiences, main categories expectation. sort whether
not thought expect thing going happen, right? someone
tells going hurt, going give injection right here, might hurt
second. different experience pain will different
happened suddenly blue. also anxiety, anxious, high
low level arousal, autonomic arousal, going impact experience
pleasure pain. well slept so-called circadian 24-

can imagine daylight waking hours better able
tolerate, resilient pain, better able experience pleasure.
night threshold pain much lower. words, amount mechanical

rate response much lower night. particular, hours
2:00 5:00 AM, kind standard circadian schedule.
last one genes. Pain threshold long pain response lasts
part dictated genes. later going discuss myth whether not

just give little sneak peek that, indeed genetic


difference particular gene, particular pattern receptors skin

talk expectation anxiety two factors can powerfully modulate

now number solid experiments, animal models humans point
fact know painful stimulus coming, can better prepare
mentally therefore buffer reduce pain response. However, timing
anticipation occurs vital happen. timing isn't quite right,
actually can make experience pain far worse. summarizing large

enormous variation people can embrace experience cold. noticed
work athletes work military
work general public. one best tests somebody can handle
pain ask just get ice bath. not sophisticated experience,
really gets core kind circuitry talking about,

experience cold aversive somehow cannot get in.
start quaking, start complaining many just simply get out.
can't it. don't even get past knees. isn't necessarily pain
threshold, related that. think can helpful everyone know even
though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense

stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain

arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,

called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked

Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce

acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well

generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic

compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix

metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows

talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look

intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair
skinned. Sometimes freckles, not always. course red hair.
people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger
feeding POMC. POMC stands pro-opiomelanocortin POMC cut
up. cleaved different hormones, including one enhances pain perception.
melanocyte stimulating hormone. another one blocks pain beta
endorphin. Now, listen episodes testosterone estrogen

interesting study showed presence hormones
everybody. melanocortin 4, beta endorphins.
POMC et cetera, red heads make endogenous endorphins.
interesting. allows buffer pain response. personal
anecdote share red head heightened levels pain tolerance
phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.
produce endogenous opioids. Now course not taken
mean redheads can tolerate pain therefore subjected
pain, means threshold pain average, not them,
average shifted higher individuals. remains determined
whether not light skin, light haired individuals also heightened level


pain threshold. mention mentioned ice bath course
pain threshold something can built provide safely ways
aren't damaging tissues course, pain signal designed

contextual top-down modulations experience. can tell
good me, choice whatever is. can distract yourself.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells

potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not

exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

call skin, mentioned earlier, largest organ body. throughout
organ, neurons, little nerve cells. Now really technical it,
way like understand so-called cell body meaning location
cell DNA goodies kind central factory cell,
actually sits right outside spinal cord. spinal cord either

like know aficionado curious, called DRGs
dorsal root ganglia. ganglion just collection clump cells. DRGs
really interesting send one branch call axon, little wire
skin, also muscles organs, talking skin.
send wire skin wire literally reaches skin. actually
skin another wire cell body goes opposite

course pressure, hard pressure, won't respond light feather,
instance. Others respond temperature. will respond presence heat
presence cold changes heat cold. still others respond types
stimuli, like certain chemicals skin. Many probably experienced
sensation eating hot pepper. Well, don't recommend this,
take little slice jalapeno hot pepper, habanero pepper something like
rub skin, actually feel something location.
pepper doesn't just create sensation within mouth, will create
similar sensation skin. neurons amazing. collecting

second. really incredible language neurons use
exactly same. neuron responds light touch sends electrical signals
toward brain, neurons respond cold heat habanero pepper,
respond particular thing evokes electrical response. say
respond particular stimulus, pepper, cold, heat, et cetera,
will evoke electrical signal, electrical signals common language
neurons use. yet, something cold presented skin, like ice cube, even
don't see ice cube, eyes closed, someone comes behind
puts ice cube bare skin back, know sensation,
thing cold.

00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes

go areas body. can actually experience real time right
now simple experiment call two-point discrimination. Two-points
discrimination ability know whether not two points pressure far apart,
near other, actually perceive incorrectly one point pressure.
might want second person experiment. it. will
close eyes, person take two fine points. Don't make sharp,
please. two pencils pens backs pens. Two pens holding
hands. just listening this, just holding two pens. favorite pens,
pilot, V5 V7, love. close eyes take
two pens put points close together centimeter apart present
top hand, going just going now myself. You, even
though eyes closed, able perceive two points
pressure presented simultaneously top hand. However,
middle back, not experience two points pressure.
experience one single point pressure. words, two
point discrimination better, higher areas body many, many
sensory receptors. sensitive locations. Now makes
perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density
receptors across body surface has. can go step describe
another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried
neighboring area body receiving input another nerve one
doesn't virus living it. anytime see rash pattern body
surface skin pretty stark boundary, chances event
impacting dermatome. experienced not herpes simplex,
experience lot blood sort aggregating kind
segment across front face, really bizarre. looked mirror
thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines
face said, okay, rash reaction rather can happen here, not
region right next it. Whenever see chances reaction nerves


dermatome. start see things start look
them. don't always viral infection experience this. Sometimes
just experience tingling even pleasant sensation, will restricted
kind strict boundary one location body surface not another. Not
corresponding organ like, okay, arm just feet something like that.
just segment. almost like someone outlined particular area body surface.

00:28:11 Thoughts & Genes Make Physical Pain Worse

dermatome. got sensors skin got brain
going interpret going sensors. fact, can take example
sudden rash inflammation one location, dermatome, can ask
make hurt? make worse? make go away?
believe not, subjective interpretation happening profound
influence experience pleasure pain. several things can
impact experiences, main categories expectation. sort whether
not thought expect thing going happen, right? someone
tells going hurt, going give injection right here, might hurt
second. different experience pain will different
happened suddenly blue. also anxiety, anxious, high
low level arousal, autonomic arousal, going impact experience
pleasure pain. well slept so-called circadian 24-
hour cycle. ability tolerate pain changes dramatically across 24-hour cycle.
can imagine daylight waking hours better able
tolerate, resilient pain, better able experience pleasure.
night threshold pain much lower. words, amount mechanical
chemical thermal meaning temperature stimulated can evoke pain response
rate response much lower night. particular, hours
2:00 5:00 AM, kind standard circadian schedule.
last one genes. Pain threshold long pain response lasts
part dictated genes. later going discuss myth whether not
really myth whether not certain people particular red heads, people
reg pigmented hair fair skin, whether not pain thresholds differ.
just give little sneak peek that, indeed genetic


difference particular gene, particular pattern receptors skin
related pigmentation hair skin. expectation, anxiety, well
slept, so-called 24-hour circadian time genes.
talk expectation anxiety two factors can powerfully modulate
experience pleasure pain ways will allow us dial pleasure
like dial pain, indeed want do. talk
expectation anxiety two things somewhat tethered.
now number solid experiments, animal models humans point
fact know painful stimulus coming, can better prepare
mentally therefore buffer reduce pain response. However, timing
anticipation occurs vital happen. timing isn't quite right,
actually can make experience pain far worse. summarizing large
amount literature, essentially subjects warned painful stimulus
coming, subjective experience pain vastly reduced. However,
warned just two seconds pain arrives, not help. actually makes
worse. reason can't anything mentally prepare brief two
second window. Similarly, warned pain coming two minutes
painful stimulus coming electric shock poke cold stimulus heat
stimulus pretty extreme, also makes worse expectation ramps
autonomic arousal. level alertness funneled toward negative
experience coming. soon painful stimulus know
goal reduce level pain? answer somewhere 20
seconds 40 seconds right. Now, averaging across number different

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair
skinned. Sometimes freckles, not always. course red hair.
people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger
feeding POMC. POMC stands pro-opiomelanocortin POMC cut
up. cleaved different hormones, including one enhances pain perception.
melanocyte stimulating hormone. another one blocks pain beta

interesting. allows buffer pain response. personal
anecdote share red head heightened levels pain tolerance
phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.
produce endogenous opioids. Now course not taken
mean redheads can tolerate pain therefore subjected

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.

Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us

reproduction evokes sensations molecules perceptions associated
pleasure. currency pleasure exists multiple chemical systems
primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure
work required achieve ability experience pleasure, serotonin

dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated

contain neurons also manufacturer make use molecule oxytocin.
chemicals together create sensations warmth, well being, safety. dopamine

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids
accomplishments, don't want every time. sure will

00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes

go areas body. can actually experience real time right
now simple experiment call two-point discrimination. Two-points
discrimination ability know whether not two points pressure far apart,
near other, actually perceive incorrectly one point pressure.
might want second person experiment. it. will
close eyes, person take two fine points. Don't make sharp,
please. two pencils pens backs pens. Two pens holding
hands. just listening this, just holding two pens. favorite pens,
pilot, V5 V7, love. close eyes take
two pens put points close together centimeter apart present
top hand, going just going now myself. You, even
though eyes closed, able perceive two points
pressure presented simultaneously top hand. However,
middle back, not experience two points pressure.
experience one single point pressure. words, two
point discrimination better, higher areas body many, many
sensory receptors. sensitive locations. Now makes
perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density
receptors across body surface has. can go step describe
another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried
neighboring area body receiving input another nerve one
doesn't virus living it. anytime see rash pattern body
surface skin pretty stark boundary, chances event
impacting dermatome. experienced not herpes simplex,
experience lot blood sort aggregating kind
segment across front face, really bizarre. looked mirror
thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines
face said, okay, rash reaction rather can happen here, not
region right next it. Whenever see chances reaction nerves


dermatome. start see things start look
them. don't always viral infection experience this. Sometimes
just experience tingling even pleasant sensation, will restricted
kind strict boundary one location body surface not another. Not
corresponding organ like, okay, arm just feet something like that.
just segment. almost like someone outlined particular area body surface.

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair

people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger

2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath

think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got

friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes

go areas body. can actually experience real time right
now simple experiment call two-point discrimination. Two-points
discrimination ability know whether not two points pressure far apart,
near other, actually perceive incorrectly one point pressure.
might want second person experiment. it. will
close eyes, person take two fine points. Don't make sharp,
please. two pencils pens backs pens. Two pens holding
hands. just listening this, just holding two pens. favorite pens,
pilot, V5 V7, love. close eyes take
two pens put points close together centimeter apart present
top hand, going just going now myself. You, even
though eyes closed, able perceive two points
pressure presented simultaneously top hand. However,
middle back, not experience two points pressure.
experience one single point pressure. words, two
point discrimination better, higher areas body many, many
sensory receptors. sensitive locations. Now makes
perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density
receptors across body surface has. can go step describe
another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried

thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look

friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

perfect sense experience hear it. However, us don't
really appreciate important profound influence change density

another feature way built way experience pleasure
pain, called dermatome. dermatome literally way
body surface carved different territories. Much like map United
States carved different territories states counties, et cetera.
dermatome way neurons connect different parts body. Now,
actually experienced dermatome before. dermatome
neuron connects particular area body neuron doesn't just send
one little wire like one little line go skin detect mechanical,


thermal, chemical stimuli. actually sends many branches like tree.
remember branches tree come one single neuron. Now, occasionally
will happen will experience something like cold, heat, pain, tingling
patch body. occasionally patch body will actually
cleanly demarcated boundary, stark boundary areas around it. good
example herpes simplex 1 virus, one virus,
mention somewhere 80 90% people virus,
not sexually transmitted virus. virus transmitted easily people
various forms contact non-sexual contact, present children, present
adults people get it, get symptoms don't get recurring
symptoms, don't. can talk end, like, virus lives
called fifth cranial nerve also called trigeminal nerve. trigeminal
nerve sends branches lips, eyes, certain portions face.
listening, just kind put right hand across face sort
simulate three branches, trigeminal aspect nerve. tri three. Now,
herpes virus flares up, say, response stress factors, virus
inflames nerve people experience tingling pain nerve. Sometimes
get cold sore blister lip near mouth, sometimes get
collection those. dermatome actually inflamed. Now
people will experience something like shingles. fairly common viral infection.
notice get rash boundary. like, get bunch
bumps, sometimes blisters, it'll sharp boundary. boundary exists
virus exists nerve. actually boundaried
neighboring area body receiving input another nerve one
doesn't virus living it. anytime see rash pattern body

segment across front face, really bizarre. looked mirror
thought, going here? allergic reaction something eaten.
allergic reaction clearly affecting one nerves therefore
dermatome showed was, almost like someone drawn lines
face said, okay, rash reaction rather can happen here, not
region right next it. Whenever see chances reaction nerves


dermatome. start see things start look
them. don't always viral infection experience this. Sometimes
just experience tingling even pleasant sensation, will restricted
kind strict boundary one location body surface not another. Not

just segment. almost like someone outlined particular area body surface.

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold

people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates

think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible

friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine

autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not

exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

Nociceptor comes word noci, nocere believe is, means harm.
However, nociceptors don't carry information pain, carry information

painful painful varies. Now, physicians people physicians
treat pain, know lot data now someone comes clinic
says experiencing chronic pain whole body pain acute pain
injury one location, doesn't really matter cause even cause
all, doctor reacts report patient's pain will dictate many cases
course treatment. course doctors, goal treat patient going

found think now work done try change this,
doctor high threshold pain, interpretation somebody else's report
pain going different. might not discount patient, right? doesn't
necessarily mean think, oh, person pain irrelevant, probably not.
fact, high threshold pain, someone comes says, extreme
pain, doctor probably thinks, wow, really, really extreme, can
talking two different experiences. Similarly, physician low
threshold pain, someone comes says, yeah, experiencing pain

uncomfortable experiments can imagine, general, don't way
measuring somebody else's subjective experience pain. no blood pressure

though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water

severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense

many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even

see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain

arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,

called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked

Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce

appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.

talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic

Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write

really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find

again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense

many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even

arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,

called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked

Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce

somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well

generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic

acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix

metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows

talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not

make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch

Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic

overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine

autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain

dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say

just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited

excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care

start quaking, start complaining many just simply get out.
can't it. don't even get past knees. isn't necessarily pain
threshold, related that. think can helpful everyone know even
though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause

saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within

called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole

activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic

isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,

acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows

non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point

actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories

Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved

fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain

course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

indeed case. talk range pain experiences.
that, will understand better range pleasure experiences different
people different terms pain threshold. First all,
pain threshold? Pain threshold two dimensions. first dimension amount
mechanical chemical thermal stimulation takes somebody
else say, can't take anymore. done. another element well
long pain persists. just describe example, don't consider
somebody particularly high pain threshold. don't think particularly
low either, wouldn't consider somebody particularly high pain
threshold. stubbed toe corner bed, absolutely hurts.
one thing noticed sharp inflections, high inflections
perception pain, go away quickly. don't know adaptive not.
probably not, experience pain intense, brief. people
experience pain much kind slower rising, longer-lasting manner. just
really point varied terms experience pain, look
experiment. experiments done Stanford School Medicine
elsewhere, involved subjects put hand cold vat water
measuring amount time kept hand water.
tell experimenter quietly, painful particular stimulus
scale one 10 so-called Likert scale aficionados. simple experiment
revealed people experience thermal case, cold stimulus, vastly
different. people rate 10 10 extreme pain. people
rate barely painful all, like one. people, three people, five, et
cetera. Now interesting thing true experience hot,
painful stimulus 120 degree hot plate, put hand it,
point remove hand. people able keep hand
whole time, people rate experience painful, little bit painful
moderately painful depending are. Now, interesting, probably not
surprising, however, interesting experiment
done medical doctors medical doctors training, course experienced
pain range subjective experiences. just like person
off street said particular stimulus particular temperature painful,
said wasn't painful said moderately painful. turns


vitally important treatment pain pain not event skin.
Pain subjective, emotional experience. may heard
particular category DRGs innervate skin, called nociceptors.
Nociceptor comes word noci, nocere believe is, means harm.
However, nociceptors don't carry information pain, carry information
particular types stimuli impacting skin. brain assigns value
valence it, label says painful. people draw line not
painful painful varies. Now, physicians people physicians
treat pain, know lot data now someone comes clinic
says experiencing chronic pain whole body pain acute pain
injury one location, doesn't really matter cause even cause
all, doctor reacts report patient's pain will dictate many cases
course treatment. course doctors, goal treat patient going
patient's needs, not own. good doctors do. However,
found think now work done try change this,
doctor high threshold pain, interpretation somebody else's report
pain going different. might not discount patient, right? doesn't
necessarily mean think, oh, person pain irrelevant, probably not.
fact, high threshold pain, someone comes says, extreme
pain, doctor probably thinks, wow, really, really extreme, can
talking two different experiences. Similarly, physician low
threshold pain, someone comes says, yeah, experiencing pain
back. got sciatica thing, yeah, little bit uncomfortable. like a,
don't know like four 10. Well, physician might interpret four 10
pretty extreme sense pain pretty extreme experience pain. can
start see subjective nature pain can start real impact
treatment pain treatment pain carried physicians. fact,
no objective measure pain. can ask long somebody can keep hand
hot plate cold bath. can various experiments. even
extreme experiments shave portion leg put
painful chemical compound see long people can tolerate that.
uncomfortable experiments can imagine, general, don't way
measuring somebody else's subjective experience pain. no blood pressure
measure. no heart rate beats per minute measure pain. one great


efforts neuroscience medicine try come objective
measures pain. Similarly, pleasure something talk about. Ooh, feels
good, love please less that, no way
gauging people experiencing except report language.
really just illustrate whole thing around pain isn't black box.
understanding elements. elements skin,
elements brain, expectation, anxiety, sleep, genes,
complicated. yet certain principles fall complicated picture

00:40:27 Protocol 2: Cold Sensing Relative; Getting Cold Water

can allow us better understand navigate axis call pleasure-
pain axis. rather focus just subjective nature pain, talk
absolute qualities pain absolute qualities pleasure can learn
navigate two experiences ways serve us better. First all, want
talk heat cold. indeed sensors skin respond heat
cold. entered cold shower cold body water
kind ice bath, et cetera, will realize getting cold much harder
slowly. Now, despite people tend slowly. noticed
enormous variation people can embrace experience cold. noticed
work athletes work military
work general public. one best tests somebody can handle
pain ask just get ice bath. not sophisticated experience,
really gets core kind circuitry talking about,
skin brain. people regardless sex, regardless age, regardless
physical ability can just get cold. somehow able it. Now, don't
know experience cold is. neither you. know
experience, able that. quickly, slowly. Others find
experience cold aversive somehow cannot get in.
start quaking, start complaining many just simply get out.
can't it. don't even get past knees. isn't necessarily pain
threshold, related that. think can helpful everyone know even
though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water
warm body water colder, sometimes ocean, notice
warm. swim further, get pocket water much
colder. cold receptors skin start firing sending signals
brain. Therefore, can bypass signals going brain
relative change one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera, simply getting
once. fact true maybe told before, true
get cold water neck, actually much comfortable
halfway halfway out. difference signals
sent cold receptors upper torso, water
lower torso. Now, wouldn't want anyone take mean just
jump unknown body water. sorts factors like currents,
very, cold, yes, indeed. can stop heart. People can heart attacks
getting extremely cold water, like melted mountain stream frozen
winter, very, cold snow pack going it. cold, can
indeed heart attack. please smart cold bodies cold
water happen put into. absolutely true provided safe,
getting cold water always going easier quickly going
easier neck. fact, actually want get shoulders submerged.
number things can really want safe do.
can put face activate so-called dive reflex, also makes
tolerance cold easier believe not. counterintuitive. like getting
water faster completely will experience less uncomfortable, less cold.
indeed case. cold receptors measuring
every relative drop temperature. every single one graded say biology,
not absolute. additional point, sitting body cold water
not circulating, notice start warm little bit. even feel like
freezing cold, move water around moves, course,
notice got even colder. thermal layer. actually
heating water surrounds body like halo around every aspect
body. sort silhouette heat heating water.



00:45:22 Protocol 3: Heat Absolute

move, disrupt thermal layer. Now heat opposite. Heat
heat receptors skin respond absolute changes temperature.
probably body brain can tolerate drops temperature much better
can tolerate increases temperature safely. move say
standard outdoor environment, mean, States measure terms
Fahrenheit. maybe 75 80 degree, even 90 degree day, get
100 degrees sauna, cool air conditioned building go outside
warm outside, sort feel like heat hits once, boom. Hits
once, kind like slap face, will just stay level.
body will acclimate particular temperature. However, temperature very,
high, notice experience heat experience kind
pain discomfort desire get heat will tend persist. don't
really adapt way. certain people really good handling
hot sauna, get better this. learned calm breathing, et cetera, lower
autonomic arousal. Obviously don't want let body temperature go high
neurons cook, die. neurons die, don't come back bad.
Many people unfortunately harm hyperthermia. Everyone different
threshold this, general, don't want body temperature go
high. fever like 103 starts become worrisome 104. really get
concerned goes range higher, need really cool
body get hospital can cool down. Heat measured
absolute terms neurons. gradually moving heat makes sense, finding
threshold, safe comfortable you, uncomfortable, least
resides within realm safety. heat cold, sort non-
negotiables. can try lower level arousal. fact, many people get
cold shower ice bath think recommendation always give
two possible approaches that. can either try relax yourself, kind just
stay calm within cold, can lean it. can actually take mental steps
generate adrenaline kind meet demands cold. point
whole episode use cold heat certain advantages done
little bit past episodes using cold supercharge human performance


things sort. general, cold measured relative terms. therefore
getting good idea provided can safely. heat measured
absolute levels brain body therefore

00:48:10 Injury & Pain

want actually move gradually. kind inverse
might think. One important things understand experience pain
really illustrate just subjective pain really is, experience pain
degree damage body not always correlated. fact, sometimes
can opposite directions. good example x-rays.
occasionally get x-rays least US get x-rays go dentist
time time, occasional x-ray might safe depending provide
not pregnant, et cetera. gone dentist. put chair,
cover lead blanket, run behind screen protect
themselves. beam x-rays get picture teeth
jaws skull, et cetera. Well, get many x-rays,
severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went
boot looked saw nail going boot
absolute excruciating pain. took hospital nail
long entered, exited boot, cut away
boot order get nail. that, revealed nail
passed two toes. actually failed impale body way.
yet view, perception nail entering boot one end exiting boot
sufficient create experience nail gone
foot. moment realized nail not gone foot, pain
completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab
formerly University California, San Diego. done lot work
phantom limb phenomenon. Ramachandra actually started off vision scientist.
understood power visual system dictating experience things
like pain pleasure. developed low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment phantom limb. consisted box,
literally box mirrors inside it. patient put intact hand
limb one side, obviously couldn't put amputated limb side,
configuration mirrors, appeared though two
symmetric limbs inside box. look limb
move around. this, report real time movement,
say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged
experiences. mean that? Well, Ramchandran described patient
somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet
genitalia, well lips face actually highest sensory innervation


entire body. speaks to, think, important general
principle people experience pleasure pain, aspect
pain pleasure can highly localized. can cut particular
location body can fall injury kind bruise one side
body. yet experience pleasure pain can also almost body-
wide experience. yet always rich. always heightened
regions body dense sensory innervation. experience pain
pleasure according local phenomenon receptors skin, homunculus map
different territories, way territories
related, kind wild example somebody experiencing orgasm phantom
foot speaks larger experience. typical rather experience
say people have, pleasure can body-wide can experience
face bottoms feet areas body experience
pleasure similarly pain.

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people

vitally important treatment pain pain not event skin.
Pain subjective, emotional experience. may heard
particular category DRGs innervate skin, called nociceptors.
Nociceptor comes word noci, nocere believe is, means harm.
However, nociceptors don't carry information pain, carry information
particular types stimuli impacting skin. brain assigns value
valence it, label says painful. people draw line not
painful painful varies. Now, physicians people physicians
treat pain, know lot data now someone comes clinic
says experiencing chronic pain whole body pain acute pain
injury one location, doesn't really matter cause even cause
all, doctor reacts report patient's pain will dictate many cases
course treatment. course doctors, goal treat patient going
patient's needs, not own. good doctors do. However,
found think now work done try change this,
doctor high threshold pain, interpretation somebody else's report
pain going different. might not discount patient, right? doesn't
necessarily mean think, oh, person pain irrelevant, probably not.
fact, high threshold pain, someone comes says, extreme
pain, doctor probably thinks, wow, really, really extreme, can
talking two different experiences. Similarly, physician low
threshold pain, someone comes says, yeah, experiencing pain
back. got sciatica thing, yeah, little bit uncomfortable. like a,
don't know like four 10. Well, physician might interpret four 10
pretty extreme sense pain pretty extreme experience pain. can
start see subjective nature pain can start real impact
treatment pain treatment pain carried physicians. fact,
no objective measure pain. can ask long somebody can keep hand
hot plate cold bath. can various experiments. even
extreme experiments shave portion leg put
painful chemical compound see long people can tolerate that.
uncomfortable experiments can imagine, general, don't way
measuring somebody else's subjective experience pain. no blood pressure
measure. no heart rate beats per minute measure pain. one great


efforts neuroscience medicine try come objective
measures pain. Similarly, pleasure something talk about. Ooh, feels
good, love please less that, no way
gauging people experiencing except report language.
really just illustrate whole thing around pain isn't black box.
understanding elements. elements skin,
elements brain, expectation, anxiety, sleep, genes,
complicated. yet certain principles fall complicated picture

00:40:27 Protocol 2: Cold Sensing Relative; Getting Cold Water

can allow us better understand navigate axis call pleasure-
pain axis. rather focus just subjective nature pain, talk
absolute qualities pain absolute qualities pleasure can learn
navigate two experiences ways serve us better. First all, want
talk heat cold. indeed sensors skin respond heat
cold. entered cold shower cold body water
kind ice bath, et cetera, will realize getting cold much harder
slowly. Now, despite people tend slowly. noticed
enormous variation people can embrace experience cold. noticed
work athletes work military
work general public. one best tests somebody can handle
pain ask just get ice bath. not sophisticated experience,
really gets core kind circuitry talking about,
skin brain. people regardless sex, regardless age, regardless
physical ability can just get cold. somehow able it. Now, don't
know experience cold is. neither you. know
experience, able that. quickly, slowly. Others find
experience cold aversive somehow cannot get in.
start quaking, start complaining many just simply get out.
can't it. don't even get past knees. isn't necessarily pain
threshold, related that. think can helpful everyone know even
though feels better mental level get cold slowly people ask, oh,
just want get slowly, want take time. actually much worse neuro-


biological perspective. neurons sense cold respond called relative
drops temperature. not absolute temperature water.
relative change temperature. move particular temperature,
whether not air next ice bath cold shower, body water
warm body water colder, sometimes ocean, notice
warm. swim further, get pocket water much
colder. cold receptors skin start firing sending signals
brain. Therefore, can bypass signals going brain
relative change one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera, simply getting
once. fact true maybe told before, true
get cold water neck, actually much comfortable
halfway halfway out. difference signals
sent cold receptors upper torso, water
lower torso. Now, wouldn't want anyone take mean just
jump unknown body water. sorts factors like currents,
very, cold, yes, indeed. can stop heart. People can heart attacks
getting extremely cold water, like melted mountain stream frozen
winter, very, cold snow pack going it. cold, can
indeed heart attack. please smart cold bodies cold
water happen put into. absolutely true provided safe,
getting cold water always going easier quickly going
easier neck. fact, actually want get shoulders submerged.
number things can really want safe do.
can put face activate so-called dive reflex, also makes
tolerance cold easier believe not. counterintuitive. like getting
water faster completely will experience less uncomfortable, less cold.
indeed case. cold receptors measuring
every relative drop temperature. every single one graded say biology,
not absolute. additional point, sitting body cold water
not circulating, notice start warm little bit. even feel like
freezing cold, move water around moves, course,
notice got even colder. thermal layer. actually
heating water surrounds body like halo around every aspect
body. sort silhouette heat heating water.



00:45:22 Protocol 3: Heat Absolute

move, disrupt thermal layer. Now heat opposite. Heat
heat receptors skin respond absolute changes temperature.
probably body brain can tolerate drops temperature much better
can tolerate increases temperature safely. move say
standard outdoor environment, mean, States measure terms
Fahrenheit. maybe 75 80 degree, even 90 degree day, get
100 degrees sauna, cool air conditioned building go outside
warm outside, sort feel like heat hits once, boom. Hits
once, kind like slap face, will just stay level.
body will acclimate particular temperature. However, temperature very,
high, notice experience heat experience kind
pain discomfort desire get heat will tend persist. don't
really adapt way. certain people really good handling
hot sauna, get better this. learned calm breathing, et cetera, lower
autonomic arousal. Obviously don't want let body temperature go high
neurons cook, die. neurons die, don't come back bad.
Many people unfortunately harm hyperthermia. Everyone different
threshold this, general, don't want body temperature go
high. fever like 103 starts become worrisome 104. really get
concerned goes range higher, need really cool
body get hospital can cool down. Heat measured
absolute terms neurons. gradually moving heat makes sense, finding
threshold, safe comfortable you, uncomfortable, least
resides within realm safety. heat cold, sort non-
negotiables. can try lower level arousal. fact, many people get
cold shower ice bath think recommendation always give
two possible approaches that. can either try relax yourself, kind just
stay calm within cold, can lean it. can actually take mental steps
generate adrenaline kind meet demands cold. point
whole episode use cold heat certain advantages done
little bit past episodes using cold supercharge human performance


things sort. general, cold measured relative terms. therefore
getting good idea provided can safely. heat measured
absolute levels brain body therefore

00:48:10 Injury & Pain

want actually move gradually. kind inverse
might think. One important things understand experience pain
really illustrate just subjective pain really is, experience pain
degree damage body not always correlated. fact, sometimes
can opposite directions. good example x-rays.
occasionally get x-rays least US get x-rays go dentist
time time, occasional x-ray might safe depending provide
not pregnant, et cetera. gone dentist. put chair,
cover lead blanket, run behind screen protect
themselves. beam x-rays get picture teeth
jaws skull, et cetera. Well, get many x-rays,
severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went
boot looked saw nail going boot
absolute excruciating pain. took hospital nail
long entered, exited boot, cut away
boot order get nail. that, revealed nail
passed two toes. actually failed impale body way.
yet view, perception nail entering boot one end exiting boot
sufficient create experience nail gone
foot. moment realized nail not gone foot, pain
completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab
formerly University California, San Diego. done lot work
phantom limb phenomenon. Ramachandra actually started off vision scientist.
understood power visual system dictating experience things
like pain pleasure. developed low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment phantom limb. consisted box,
literally box mirrors inside it. patient put intact hand
limb one side, obviously couldn't put amputated limb side,
configuration mirrors, appeared though two
symmetric limbs inside box. look limb
move around. this, report real time movement,
say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged
experiences. mean that? Well, Ramchandran described patient
somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet
genitalia, well lips face actually highest sensory innervation


entire body. speaks to, think, important general
principle people experience pleasure pain, aspect
pain pleasure can highly localized. can cut particular
location body can fall injury kind bruise one side
body. yet experience pleasure pain can also almost body-
wide experience. yet always rich. always heightened
regions body dense sensory innervation. experience pain
pleasure according local phenomenon receptors skin, homunculus map
different territories, way territories
related, kind wild example somebody experiencing orgasm phantom
foot speaks larger experience. typical rather experience
say people have, pleasure can body-wide can experience
face bottoms feet areas body experience
pleasure similarly pain.

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds
sperms swim, straight swim turns swimming sperm efficient
swim straight, opposed like kids swim team, like
banging lane lines zigzagging place. turn

good sperm know that, less good sperm don't seem know that.
acetylcarnitine seems facilitate straight swimming trajectories well speed

studies showing acetylcarnitine supplementation can also beneficial women's
fertility ways affects perhaps don't really know mechanism, health
status egg egg implantation. large number studies

studies don't think included particularly
interesting. One just like reference last name first author
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I. title paper Effects l -Carnitine Supplementation
Serum Inflammatory Markers Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes Females
Knee Osteoarthritis. randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot
study showed really interesting effects short term supplementation
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows
certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia come like low ambulances, like low
paramedics clean wounds. scarring inflammation kind double-
edged sword. can good, much scarring. contains wound much,
doesn't allow infiltration cell types move take care wound heal
up. appears L-carnitine impacting number different processes,
impact pain perhaps, want underscore perhaps,

01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate*

good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing well.
long talking acute pain chronic pain supplementation
non-prescription drugs, least United States people can take deal
pain various kinds, remiss didn't mention two get asked often
about, agmatine S-adenosyl-L-methionine, sometimes called
SAMe. shown impact categorized examine
notable impact various forms pain, due osteoarthritis, due injury various
kinds indifferent subject population, men, women, people different ages, et cetera.
particular interesting shown head head
drugs like Naproxen drugs sort, well established sold
counter US work least well compounds
certain doses. also shown things take time
order effects. fact, head head things like Neproxin
shown can take month order pain relieving effect. Now,
whether not makes better choice worst choice really depends
circumstances. certainly not recommending anybody take anything,
think interesting important point things like agmatine, things like
shown certain circumstances beneficial pain
outside realm prescription drugs. think growing area people call


supplements, people call nutraceuticals. Look, end day
compounds affect cellular processes. understand

non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships

thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't

people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine

autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people

supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense

many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even

arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,

called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th

no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce

somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well

generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic

acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally

metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows

talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic

Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular

Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure

ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole

might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,
incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went
boot looked saw nail going boot
absolute excruciating pain. took hospital nail
long entered, exited boot, cut away
boot order get nail. that, revealed nail
passed two toes. actually failed impale body way.
yet view, perception nail entering boot one end exiting boot
sufficient create experience nail gone
foot. moment realized nail not gone foot, pain
completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab
formerly University California, San Diego. done lot work
phantom limb phenomenon. Ramachandra actually started off vision scientist.
understood power visual system dictating experience things
like pain pleasure. developed low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment phantom limb. consisted box,
literally box mirrors inside it. patient put intact hand
limb one side, obviously couldn't put amputated limb side,
configuration mirrors, appeared though two
symmetric limbs inside box. look limb
move around. this, report real time movement,
say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged
experiences. mean that? Well, Ramchandran described patient
somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet
genitalia, well lips face actually highest sensory innervation


entire body. speaks to, think, important general
principle people experience pleasure pain, aspect
pain pleasure can highly localized. can cut particular
location body can fall injury kind bruise one side
body. yet experience pleasure pain can also almost body-
wide experience. yet always rich. always heightened
regions body dense sensory innervation. experience pain
pleasure according local phenomenon receptors skin, homunculus map
different territories, way territories

pleasure similarly pain.

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people

Many people unfortunately harm hyperthermia. Everyone different

really illustrate just subjective pain really is, experience pain
degree damage body not always correlated. fact, sometimes
can opposite directions. good example x-rays.
occasionally get x-rays least US get x-rays go dentist
time time, occasional x-ray might safe depending provide
not pregnant, et cetera. gone dentist. put chair,
cover lead blanket, run behind screen protect
themselves. beam x-rays get picture teeth
jaws skull, et cetera. Well, get many x-rays,
severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went
boot looked saw nail going boot
absolute excruciating pain. took hospital nail
long entered, exited boot, cut away
boot order get nail. that, revealed nail
passed two toes. actually failed impale body way.
yet view, perception nail entering boot one end exiting boot
sufficient create experience nail gone
foot. moment realized nail not gone foot, pain
completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab

incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed

successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks

case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged
experiences. mean that? Well, Ramchandran described patient
somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet

entire body. speaks to, think, important general
principle people experience pleasure pain, aspect
pain pleasure can highly localized. can cut particular

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds
sperms swim, straight swim turns swimming sperm efficient
swim straight, opposed like kids swim team, like
banging lane lines zigzagging place. turn

good sperm know that, less good sperm don't seem know that.
acetylcarnitine seems facilitate straight swimming trajectories well speed
swimming overall sperm health. evidence quality peer reviewed
studies showing acetylcarnitine supplementation can also beneficial women's
fertility ways affects perhaps don't really know mechanism, health
status egg egg implantation. large number studies
acetylcarnitine. can look Pub Med, like, examine.com.
studies don't think included particularly
interesting. One just like reference last name first author

Serum Inflammatory Markers Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes Females
Knee Osteoarthritis. randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot
study showed really interesting effects short term supplementation
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows
certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia come like low ambulances, like low
paramedics clean wounds. scarring inflammation kind double-
edged sword. can good, much scarring. contains wound much,
doesn't allow infiltration cell types move take care wound heal
up. appears L-carnitine impacting number different processes,
impact pain perhaps, want underscore perhaps,

01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate*

good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing well.
long talking acute pain chronic pain supplementation
non-prescription drugs, least United States people can take deal
pain various kinds, remiss didn't mention two get asked often
about, agmatine S-adenosyl-L-methionine, sometimes called
SAMe. shown impact categorized examine

certain doses. also shown things take time
order effects. fact, head head things like Neproxin
shown can take month order pain relieving effect. Now,
whether not makes better choice worst choice really depends

non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed
supplement form, tropical legume. actually bean called Mucuna
pruriens. M-U-C-U-N-A one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S Mucuna pruriens
bean, legume bean 99% L-DOPA. dopamine rather
precursor dopamine people buy stuff take counter ways
increase levels dopamine. make feel really dopamine doubt, meaning
makes feel little high really motivated really energetic lot like
drugs will that. don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens.
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make feel good. crash really hard take
it. outside bean compound makes people itch. remove
take supplement form. fact, usually capsule form,
outside bean, like hairy bean. little hairs contain compound,
actually used study identify itchy receptors skin.
don't time go details itch, pretty interesting
compounds nature can make us itch. Inside dopamine.
mean, really weird, plant compounds really powerful. don't let anyone
tell something's plant earth not powerful.
powerful plant herb compounds. Mucuna prurien one


dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles
different parts body. needles able pass electrical current, not
magically, little wire going back device can pass
electrical current. found. study published journal neuron
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, high stringency. Qiufu Ma's lab found
electroacupuncture provided abdomen, stomach area,

means together. activated bunch neurons along spinal cord.
activation neurons evolves neural adrenaline something called NPY
neuropeptide Y. long short stimulating abdomen
electroacupuncture either anti-inflammatory cause inflammation.
actually exacerbate inflammation depending whether not low high

reason people report relief acupuncture others not. However,
went step stimulated areas body using
electroacupuncture. found stimulation legs hind limbs,
called animals, legs humans caused circuit, neural circuit
activated goes legs area base brain called DMV
not DMH, mentioned earlier, DMV like go DMV,
miserable experience people, forgive me, DMV employees, honest
people don't enjoy going DMV patrons, go.
DMV low intensity stimulation, electroacupuncture hind limbs activated
DMV activated adrenal glands, sit top kidneys cause
release called catecholamines. strongly anti-
inflammatory. words, electroacupuncture legs feet can, done
correctly, anti-inflammatory reduce symptoms pain. can think
accelerate wound healing activations catecholaminergic pathways can
accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come
start explore underlying mechanism. Now, love acupuncture
real proponents it, worked you, might say, well, Western
medicine even need come this? even exploring this?
relieved starting happen now
mechanistic basis starting come light, insurance coverage things like
acupuncture starting emerge well. contrast therapies
lot anecdotal evidence, little mechanistic understanding. One
example laser photo biomodulation use lasers different types
really treat pain accelerate wound healing. lot people claim can
really help them. However, places, least States, won't cover
insurance don't perform standard clinics. reason underlying
mechanism isn't known. not going get argument whether not
mechanistic understanding not required order insurance
coverage things work. not about. actually will
boring discussion shouting tunnel you. wouldn't able
hear shout back no matter stance is, just trust
say relieved delighted hear excellent medical institutions like
Stanford starting think electroacupuncture can work. places
like Harvard Medical School starting explore mechanistic level.
believe open-mindedness starting emerge instance,
National Institutes Health, not institute mental health cancer
research eye institute, now complementary health, so-called NCCIH.
National Institutes Complementary Health exploring things like
electroacupuncture, meditation, various supplements things sort. think
entering new realm things like pain pain management will

rub skin area, provide pressure nearby it, activate so-
called fibers, bigger wires neurons innovate, meaning jut

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair
skinned. Sometimes freckles, not always. course red hair.
people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger
feeding POMC. POMC stands pro-opiomelanocortin POMC cut
up. cleaved different hormones, including one enhances pain perception.
melanocyte stimulating hormone. another one blocks pain beta
endorphin. Now, listen episodes testosterone estrogen

phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids
accomplishments, don't want every time. sure will

00:48:10 Injury & Pain

want actually move gradually. kind inverse
might think. One important things understand experience pain
really illustrate just subjective pain really is, experience pain
degree damage body not always correlated. fact, sometimes
can opposite directions. good example x-rays.
occasionally get x-rays least US get x-rays go dentist
time time, occasional x-ray might safe depending provide
not pregnant, et cetera. gone dentist. put chair,
cover lead blanket, run behind screen protect
themselves. beam x-rays get picture teeth
jaws skull, et cetera. Well, get many x-rays,
severely damage tissues body, don't experience pain
x-ray itself. contrast, can think body damaged experienced
extreme pain yet body can no damage. classic example
published British Journal Medicine, construction worker fell
think second story, working nail went
boot looked saw nail going boot
absolute excruciating pain. took hospital nail
long entered, exited boot, cut away
boot order get nail. that, revealed nail
passed two toes. actually failed impale body way.
yet view, perception nail entering boot one end exiting boot
sufficient create experience nail gone
foot. moment realized nail not gone foot, pain
completely evaporated. demonstrated numerous times. People
work emergency rooms actually see variations this. Not always extreme,
many times see perceive wound event profound
influence experience pain. mentioned this, not just kind


sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab
formerly University California, San Diego. done lot work
phantom limb phenomenon. Ramachandra actually started off vision scientist.
understood power visual system dictating experience things
like pain pleasure. developed low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment phantom limb. consisted box,
literally box mirrors inside it. patient put intact hand
limb one side, obviously couldn't put amputated limb side,
configuration mirrors, appeared though two
symmetric limbs inside box. look limb
move around. this, report real time movement,
say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged
experiences. mean that? Well, Ramchandran described patient
somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet
genitalia, well lips face actually highest sensory innervation


entire body. speaks to, think, important general
principle people experience pleasure pain, aspect
pain pleasure can highly localized. can cut particular
location body can fall injury kind bruise one side
body. yet experience pleasure pain can also almost body-
wide experience. yet always rich. always heightened
regions body dense sensory innervation. experience pain
pleasure according local phenomenon receptors skin, homunculus map

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

sensational fantastic example extreme, subjective nature pain, also
brings us back element is, don't know people feel.
Not just pain, pleasure. think do, general sense
whether not event painful pleasurable, actually barely
understand feel let alone people feel, can badly wrong
feel meaning can misinterpret sense pain sense
pleasure depending see eyes hear ears.
hear scream like shrill scream, think must pain. look
something happening somebody fits prior category prior
representation consider painful stimulus, well, think
extreme pain, actually might not pain all. Now highly
subjective nature pain way use visual system interpret
people's pain pain actually leveraged treat
extreme form chronic pain. absolutely fascinating area biology
neuroscience. one can actually leverage toward reducing
levels pain

00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity Pain: Key Role Vision

whenever injured. believe not, even chronic pain. describe area
science requires kind extreme example, want clear even
don't suffer extreme example, relevance tool extract you.
extreme example amputated digit, meaning one fingers
toes, amputated limb. people digits limbs gone missing
injury surgical removal, will often experience still there.
so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, be? Well, remove
particular finger limb, obviously finger limb gone dorsal root
ganglion neuron normally send wire particular region body,
wire no longer portion body no longer there.
cases, neurons die almost always, not always. However, map
so-called homunculus, representation brain still there.
map, so-called homunculus map plastic. can
change. consequence areas map adjacent one another can
actually start invade areas map. instance, neuroimaging


studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab

interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed

leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments

maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged

somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds
sperms swim, straight swim turns swimming sperm efficient
swim straight, opposed like kids swim team, like
banging lane lines zigzagging place. turn

good sperm know that, less good sperm don't seem know that.
acetylcarnitine seems facilitate straight swimming trajectories well speed

studies showing acetylcarnitine supplementation can also beneficial women's
fertility ways affects perhaps don't really know mechanism, health
status egg egg implantation. large number studies
acetylcarnitine. can look Pub Med, like, examine.com.
studies don't think included particularly
interesting. One just like reference last name first author
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I. title paper Effects l -Carnitine Supplementation
Serum Inflammatory Markers Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes Females
Knee Osteoarthritis. randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot
study showed really interesting effects short term supplementation
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows
certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia come like low ambulances, like low
paramedics clean wounds. scarring inflammation kind double-
edged sword. can good, much scarring. contains wound much,
doesn't allow infiltration cell types move take care wound heal
up. appears L-carnitine impacting number different processes,
impact pain perhaps, want underscore perhaps,

01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate*

good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing well.
long talking acute pain chronic pain supplementation
non-prescription drugs, least United States people can take deal
pain various kinds, remiss didn't mention two get asked often
about, agmatine S-adenosyl-L-methionine, sometimes called
SAMe. shown impact categorized examine

certain doses. also shown things take time
order effects. fact, head head things like Neproxin
shown can take month order pain relieving effect. Now,
whether not makes better choice worst choice really depends

non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed

drugs will that. don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens.
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make feel good. crash really hard take
it. outside bean compound makes people itch. remove
take supplement form. fact, usually capsule form,
outside bean, like hairy bean. little hairs contain compound,
actually used study identify itchy receptors skin.
don't time go details itch, pretty interesting
compounds nature can make us itch. Inside dopamine.
mean, really weird, plant compounds really powerful. don't let anyone
tell something's plant earth not powerful.
powerful plant herb compounds. Mucuna prurien one


dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles

DMV low intensity stimulation, electroacupuncture hind limbs activated
DMV activated adrenal glands, sit top kidneys cause

correctly, anti-inflammatory reduce symptoms pain. can think
accelerate wound healing activations catecholaminergic pathways can
accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come
start explore underlying mechanism. Now, love acupuncture
real proponents it, worked you, might say, well, Western
medicine even need come this? even exploring this?
relieved starting happen now
mechanistic basis starting come light, insurance coverage things like
acupuncture starting emerge well. contrast therapies
lot anecdotal evidence, little mechanistic understanding. One
example laser photo biomodulation use lasers different types
really treat pain accelerate wound healing. lot people claim can
really help them. However, places, least States, won't cover
insurance don't perform standard clinics. reason underlying
mechanism isn't known. not going get argument whether not
mechanistic understanding not required order insurance
coverage things work. not about. actually will
boring discussion shouting tunnel you. wouldn't able
hear shout back no matter stance is, just trust
say relieved delighted hear excellent medical institutions like
Stanford starting think electroacupuncture can work. places

non supplement tools less powerful indeed many people experience
tremendous relief them. course, also can combined drug
treatments right supplements things sort treat pain,
right you. again, electroacupuncture now often supported insurance,
not always, often. Great mechanistic data starting emerge. Hypnosis, terrific tool.
even self-hypnosis tool one can access zero cost app
Reveri lots great clinical data scientific mechanistic data. neuro
imaging studies showing different brain areas activated hypnosis so-called
default network, kind brains kind idols different circuits
active rest shift hypnosis shift long-term ways positively
conserve you. things like laser photobiomodulation still less
experimental medical community. say, Western Medical Community, not
certain, hopefully will data soon, hopefully data will point
mechanisms allow insurance companies sort medical bodies
support indeed mechanistic basis. just want briefly touch
common method pain relief speaks general principle things like
electroacupuncture, also new emerging techniques kind like


active tissue release principle hear lot sports medicine now
pain injury one site, provide pressure
site. may seen Olympics, ongoing now
people will put tape body certain locations oftentimes. logic
saying designed create relief joint limb
tape, not necessarily tape, below. instance,
pain one shoulder, sometimes put trapezius muscle things
sort. turns basis way different
nerves run skin muscles spinal cord
brainstem providing pressure one nerve pathway can often impact another pathway.
simplest common example one instinctually
intuitively even animals this. something textbooks called
Gate Theory Pain developed Melzack Wall kind classic theory. Basically
receptors skin, so-called C fibers, just name little wires
come particular class DRGs thin brings certain kinds
nasal scepter information. want say pain information, pain people
believe not pain people. Sometimes pain tell
pain receptors okay, nociceptors information comes C fibers
happens injure something well, provided won't damage worse
touching it, oftentimes will will rub source pain location
experiencing pain. turns not unuseful thing do.
rub skin area, provide pressure nearby it, activate so-
called fibers, bigger wires neurons innovate, meaning jut
area skin. fibers, ones respond mechanical pressure actually
able inhibit C fibers, ones carrying so-called pain
information. rubbing area providing pressure injury actually
provides real pain relief support location injury pain
way different patterns different types neurons interact one
another. say inhibits it, don't mean like shouts it,
releases literally kind like vomits little bit neurotransmitter called GABA.
GABA neurotransmitter inhibits quiets activity neurons.
acting kind analgesic, will, acting form drug
make body quiet activity pain neurons. rubbing wound
provided doesn't damage wound worse providing pressure


typically particular injury can real effect relieving pain
injury. people speculated fascia,
bodily organs tissues. might going whole episode
fascia. extremely interesting tissue, right now seems main source
pain relief fiber inhibition

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair
skinned. Sometimes freckles, not always. course red hair.
people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger
feeding POMC. POMC stands pro-opiomelanocortin POMC cut
up. cleaved different hormones, including one enhances pain perception.
melanocyte stimulating hormone. another one blocks pain beta
endorphin. Now, listen episodes testosterone estrogen
episodes hunger feeding, molecules will start ring bell. Things
like melano stimulating hormone relate pigmentation skin relate sexual
arousal, et cetera, turns red heads, fact
gene, MC1R gene, POMC Pro-opiomelanocortin, cut different
hormones, melanocyte-stimulating hormones another one beta endorphin. Beta
endorphin cue fact pain pathway. endorphins
endogenously made, meaning made within body opioids. actually make us feel
numb response certain kinds pain. Now, not completely numb, numb
reduce perception pain ways released


certain brain centers. talk brain centers moment. really
interesting study showed presence hormones
everybody. melanocortin 4, beta endorphins.
POMC et cetera, red heads make endogenous endorphins.
interesting. allows buffer pain response. personal
anecdote share red head heightened levels pain tolerance
phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.
produce endogenous opioids. Now course not taken
mean redheads can tolerate pain therefore subjected
pain, means threshold pain average, not them,
average shifted higher individuals. remains determined
whether not light skin, light haired individuals also heightened level


pain threshold. mention mentioned ice bath course

contextual top-down modulations experience. can tell
good me, choice whatever is. can distract yourself.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.
conditions good greater cause fighting suffering
larger purpose. existed largely realm psychology even
motivational literature kind thing, real mechanistic basis it.
Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us
lean challenge. challenges can infection, can physical pain, can
long bouts effort required us. think many people described

01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin

experience pleasure. So, along lines, talk pleasure.
cells tissues machinery related pain, might think entire touch
system designed allow us detect pain avoid tissue damage well,
good percentage devoted that. good percentage also devoted
thing call pleasure. come no surprise. Pleasure isn't just
pleasure. serves adaptive role, adaptive role relates fact
every species primary goal make otherwise go
extinct. process making sexual reproduction closely associated
sensation perception pleasure. no surprise not
highest density sensory receptors around genitalia, process
reproduction evokes sensations molecules perceptions associated
pleasure. currency pleasure exists multiple chemical systems
primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure
work required achieve ability experience pleasure, serotonin
system closely related immediate experience pleasure.
dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated
serotonin system biochemically circuit level meaning areas
brain body manufacture lot serotonin, usually not always, usually
contain neurons also manufacturer make use molecule oxytocin.
chemicals together create sensations warmth, well being, safety. dopamine
molecule closely associated hormones like testosterone
molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole

might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens

incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

studies documented somebody say complete removal
left arm, representation left arm still exists cortex. experimentally
one stimulate area cortex, person, person you,
experience arm stimulated, even though not
there. Now, someone amputated arm doesn't need brain
stimulated order experience phantom limb present. fact,
many people limbs amputated feel limb still present even
though obviously not. no matter many times look stump just
see stump, somehow doesn't reorganize homunculus so-called central brain
map. Now, fine. might even think better, better think
arm feel missing, yet many people
amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. don't feel arm just casually
draped next them. feel bunched extreme pain. fact,
kind contorted stance taking right chair not unlike way
patients described this. feel kind cramped up,
uncomfortable them. Now, absolutely creative even say genius
scientists name Ramachandra. actually last name, complete
name little bit complicated. almost always hear Ramachandran
referred Ramachandran V.S Ramachandran full name Vilayanur
Subramanian Ramachandran. lot letters there, lot vowels,
Ramachandran neuroscientist. actually colleague mine lab

phantom limb phenomenon. Ramachandra actually started off vision scientist.
understood power visual system dictating experience things
like pain pleasure. developed low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment phantom limb. consisted box,
literally box mirrors inside it. patient put intact hand
limb one side, obviously couldn't put amputated limb side,
configuration mirrors, appeared though two
symmetric limbs inside box. look limb
move around. this, report real time movement,
say real time perception movement phantom limb. Now absolutely
incredible makes total sense think so-called top
contextual modulation sensory experience, remember anticipation, anxiety,


interpretation happening drives perception happening.
so, patients move intact limb relaxed
position, patients feel phantom limb relaxing. used
successfully treat phantom limb pain number different people. didn't always
work. can imagine sometimes might little trickier like leg although
leg boxes developed arranged purpose.
remarkable finish experiments
patient, person enter state relaxation, reduced pain phantom limb,
stay even though, course, exited mirror box, go
life use intact limb various purposes. love experiment
really speaks subjective nature pain pleasure. speaks
power visual system, like see just like nail boot
experiment. see profoundly impacts experience pleasure pain
case pain. Now, another aspect phantom limb experience
maps, so-called homunculus maps cortex Ramachandran worked on,
interesting reveals degree

00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts Merged

maps plastic can change response experience. Turns
locations different body part representations within maps, certain
parts body normally don't think related can start create merged

somewhat odd experience lost foot. actually foot
amputated midway Achilles. lower portion calf foot. don't
recall reason removed. fortunately patient,
not experience pain portion body, rather confided
whenever sex, experience orgasm phantom
foot addition genitals, course. Ramachandra understood
homunculus map. understood representation
foot within homunculus actually lies adjacent to, somewhat interdigitated
actually kind merges representation genitalia. Now weird
situation. yet now know density innovation feet

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds
sperms swim, straight swim turns swimming sperm efficient
swim straight, opposed like kids swim team, like
banging lane lines zigzagging place. turn

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds
sperms swim, straight swim turns swimming sperm efficient
swim straight, opposed like kids swim team, like
banging lane lines zigzagging place. turn
case quickest route two places straight line
good sperm know that, less good sperm don't seem know that.
acetylcarnitine seems facilitate straight swimming trajectories well speed
swimming overall sperm health. evidence quality peer reviewed
studies showing acetylcarnitine supplementation can also beneficial women's
fertility ways affects perhaps don't really know mechanism, health
status egg egg implantation. large number studies
acetylcarnitine. can look Pub Med, like, examine.com.
studies don't think included particularly
interesting. One just like reference last name first author
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I. title paper Effects l -Carnitine Supplementation
Serum Inflammatory Markers Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes Females
Knee Osteoarthritis. randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot
study showed really interesting effects short term supplementation
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows
certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia come like low ambulances, like low
paramedics clean wounds. scarring inflammation kind double-
edged sword. can good, much scarring. contains wound much,
doesn't allow infiltration cell types move take care wound heal
up. appears L-carnitine impacting number different processes,
impact pain perhaps, want underscore perhaps,

01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate*

good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing well.
long talking acute pain chronic pain supplementation
non-prescription drugs, least United States people can take deal
pain various kinds, remiss didn't mention two get asked often
about, agmatine S-adenosyl-L-methionine, sometimes called
SAMe. shown impact categorized examine

certain doses. also shown things take time
order effects. fact, head head things like Neproxin
shown can take month order pain relieving effect. Now,
whether not makes better choice worst choice really depends

order get elevated levels SAMe. Now, like turn attention completely
non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed
supplement form, tropical legume. actually bean called Mucuna
pruriens. M-U-C-U-N-A one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S Mucuna pruriens
bean, legume bean 99% L-DOPA. dopamine rather
precursor dopamine people buy stuff take counter ways
increase levels dopamine. make feel really dopamine doubt, meaning
makes feel little high really motivated really energetic lot like
drugs will that. don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens.
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make feel good. crash really hard take
it. outside bean compound makes people itch. remove
take supplement form. fact, usually capsule form,
outside bean, like hairy bean. little hairs contain compound,
actually used study identify itchy receptors skin.
don't time go details itch, pretty interesting
compounds nature can make us itch. Inside dopamine.
mean, really weird, plant compounds really powerful. don't let anyone
tell something's plant earth not powerful.
powerful plant herb compounds. Mucuna prurien one


dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles

Cell Press journal, excellent journal, high stringency. Qiufu Ma's lab found
electroacupuncture provided abdomen, stomach area,

activation neurons evolves neural adrenaline something called NPY
neuropeptide Y. long short stimulating abdomen
electroacupuncture either anti-inflammatory cause inflammation.
actually exacerbate inflammation depending whether not low high

went step stimulated areas body using
electroacupuncture. found stimulation legs hind limbs,

people don't enjoy going DMV patrons, go.
DMV low intensity stimulation, electroacupuncture hind limbs activated
DMV activated adrenal glands, sit top kidneys cause
release called catecholamines. strongly anti-
inflammatory. words, electroacupuncture legs feet can, done
correctly, anti-inflammatory reduce symptoms pain. can think
accelerate wound healing activations catecholaminergic pathways can
accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come
start explore underlying mechanism. Now, love acupuncture
real proponents it, worked you, might say, well, Western
medicine even need come this? even exploring this?
relieved starting happen now
mechanistic basis starting come light, insurance coverage things like
acupuncture starting emerge well. contrast therapies
lot anecdotal evidence, little mechanistic understanding. One
example laser photo biomodulation use lasers different types
really treat pain accelerate wound healing. lot people claim can
really help them. However, places, least States, won't cover
insurance don't perform standard clinics. reason underlying
mechanism isn't known. not going get argument whether not
mechanistic understanding not required order insurance
coverage things work. not about. actually will
boring discussion shouting tunnel you. wouldn't able
hear shout back no matter stance is, just trust
say relieved delighted hear excellent medical institutions like
Stanford starting think electroacupuncture can work. places
like Harvard Medical School starting explore mechanistic level.
believe open-mindedness starting emerge instance,
National Institutes Health, not institute mental health cancer
research eye institute, now complementary health, so-called NCCIH.

rub skin area, provide pressure nearby it, activate so-
called fibers, bigger wires neurons innovate, meaning jut

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.

serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write

really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening

treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find

again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot

01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”

brings us topic whole body pain, not just localized pain, well
whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. number examples
whole body pain people suffer from. one common one called fibromyalgia.
want just first share little bit medical insight. months back,
Instagram live Dr. Sean Mackey MD medical doctor PhD Stanford
School Medicine recorded placed Instagram. want check
out, can provide link show notes. Dr. Mackey Chief
Division Pain Stanford School Medicine. scientist. studies pain
treats patients dealing various forms pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia,
acute pain, et cetera. shared something interesting,
anytime hear see word syndrome, means medical establishment
not understand going on. syndrome constellation symptoms
point particular direction general set directions going
on, doesn't reveal true underlying disease necessarily. aggregative
diseases something else entirely. want make sure
emphasize so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. think sometimes hear
psychosomatic interpret meaning one's head. think


important remember everything neural, whether pain body 'cause
gaping wound hemorrhaging wound whether not
pain cannot explain basis kind injury. neural.
saying body, brain, psychosomatic kind irrelevant. hope someday
move past language. Psychosomatic interesting. paper
published 2015, 2020 different paper focused so-called
psychogenic fevers psychosomatic effects. just briefly want mention
relates back pain. studies shown areas so-called
thalamus, integrates filter sensory information different kinds. within
brainstem, area called DMH can also provide link study
like, shows true neurological basis. brain areas circuits
related called psychogenic fever stressed.
particular, think injured infected something, can
actually generate true fever. not imagined fever. thinking generating
increase body temperature. called psychosomatic.
called psychogenic, neural basis. hear syndrome patient
comes clinic says suffer instance, something
controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, physicians believe
reflects real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means
don't understand. doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia whole
body pain long time written off kind explained away physicians
scientists frankly, community one syndromes.

01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

couldn't explained. However, now consider think others
consider understanding least one bases whole
body pain. activation particular cell type called glial.
receptor glial want know called toll 4 receptor
activation toll 4 receptor related certain forms whole body pain
fibromyalgia. Now, treatments exist fibromyalgia. even don't suffer
fibromyalgia, even don't know anyone important
information tell relate body,
course can deal pain kind. actually things one can


take can encourage nerve health general. conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, individuals. clinical data using prescription drug.
work actually done Dr. Mackey colleagues. drug called
naltrexone. Naltrexone actually used treatment various opioid addictions
things sort, turns low dose, believe one 10th
size typical dose naltrexone shown success dealing
treating certain forms fibromyalgia. success
ability bind block toll four receptors glial. so-called syndrome
thing previously called syndrome, fibromyalgia actually biological
basis. not just inpatients heads. really tip hat medical
establishment including Dr. Mackey others explored potential underlying
biologies things like fibromyalgia starting arrive treatments. Now, not
physician, professor, not prescribing anything. talk
doctor course, fibromyalgia forms chronic whole body pain
explore whether not low dose naltrexone treatments right you. think
beautiful case study will, not case study individual patient, case
study linking patient's self-report experiences using science
try establish clinical treatments. another treatment, say
another approach one take. again, not recommending people
necessarily. determine right say you, cannot that.
no way situation's far much, outside
wheelhouse prescribe anything, particular compound United
States sold counter Europe prescription. one talked
podcast purposes. compound acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine mentioned prescription countries Europe US
can buy counter. evidence acetylcarnitine can reduce
symptoms chronic whole body pain certain forms acute pain dosages
somewhere one three sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can taken orally. found 500 milligram capsules, well
injection. injection States United States also requires
prescription requires prescription say. over-the-counter forms
generally capsules powders. apparently not require prescription.
several studies exploring acetylcarnitine context, well diabetic
neuropathy. interesting acetylcarnitine one compounds


isn't just used treatment pain, also shown certain contacts
improve peripheral nerve health generally. reason, interesting
compound. also talked acetylcarnitine previously,
robust effects things like spur motility health, including speeds

Knee Osteoarthritis. randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot
study showed really interesting effects short term supplementation
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, effects less impressive. pretty interesting
compound many different effects. effects? Well,
appears effects impact so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines don't know secreted
immune system response different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors
food eat isn't good you. so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will
increase inflammation ingested often, amounts high
quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like
interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 kind generic inflammatory marker studies refer
to. yet interleukins, please note interleukins like
interleukin 10 anti-inflammatory. immune system can secrete inflammatory
molecules deal wounds stress things. short term good,
longterm bad. can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10.


matrix metalloproteinases, kind mouthful, matrix
metalloproteinases interesting. Anytime see A-S-E, ASE generally
enzyme, means compounds case, matrix
metalloproteinases used break certain elements around wounds
scoring might sound like bad thing, cases good allows
certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia come like low ambulances, like low
paramedics clean wounds. scarring inflammation kind double-
edged sword. can good, much scarring. contains wound much,
doesn't allow infiltration cell types move take care wound heal

impact pain perhaps, want underscore perhaps,

01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-

good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing well.
long talking acute pain chronic pain supplementation

order get elevated levels SAMe. Now, like turn attention completely
non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed
supplement form, tropical legume. actually bean called Mucuna

bean, legume bean 99% L-DOPA. dopamine rather
precursor dopamine people buy stuff take counter ways
increase levels dopamine. make feel really dopamine doubt, meaning
makes feel little high really motivated really energetic lot like
drugs will that. don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens.
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make feel good. crash really hard take
it. outside bean compound makes people itch. remove
take supplement form. fact, usually capsule form,
outside bean, like hairy bean. little hairs contain compound,
actually used study identify itchy receptors skin.
don't time go details itch, pretty interesting
compounds nature can make us itch. Inside dopamine.
mean, really weird, plant compounds really powerful. don't let anyone
tell something's plant earth not powerful.
powerful plant herb compounds. Mucuna prurien one


dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles

Cell Press journal, excellent journal, high stringency. Qiufu Ma's lab found
electroacupuncture provided abdomen, stomach area,

means together. activated bunch neurons along spinal cord.
activation neurons evolves neural adrenaline something called NPY
neuropeptide Y. long short stimulating abdomen
electroacupuncture either anti-inflammatory cause inflammation.
actually exacerbate inflammation depending whether not low high

reason people report relief acupuncture others not. However,
went step stimulated areas body using
electroacupuncture. found stimulation legs hind limbs,
called animals, legs humans caused circuit, neural circuit
activated goes legs area base brain called DMV
not DMH, mentioned earlier, DMV like go DMV,
miserable experience people, forgive me, DMV employees, honest
people don't enjoy going DMV patrons, go.
DMV low intensity stimulation, electroacupuncture hind limbs activated
DMV activated adrenal glands, sit top kidneys cause
release called catecholamines. strongly anti-
inflammatory. words, electroacupuncture legs feet can, done
correctly, anti-inflammatory reduce symptoms pain. can think
accelerate wound healing activations catecholaminergic pathways can
accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come
start explore underlying mechanism. Now, love acupuncture
real proponents it, worked you, might say, well, Western
medicine even need come this? even exploring this?

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look

friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed

dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles

accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful

thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't

obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,

PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical

just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care

acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad

Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic

bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch

2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.
conditions good greater cause fighting suffering
larger purpose. existed largely realm psychology even
motivational literature kind thing, real mechanistic basis it.
Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us
lean challenge. challenges can infection, can physical pain, can
long bouts effort required us. think many people described
feeling newly love heightened level energy, capacity
anything. mean, whole concept muse one individual


thing either imagined real enters life can use fuel. fuel
chemical fuel chemical fuel dopamine. really allow
resilience can even transform experience pain otherwise

01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin

experience pleasure. So, along lines, talk pleasure.
cells tissues machinery related pain, might think entire touch
system designed allow us detect pain avoid tissue damage well,
good percentage devoted that. good percentage also devoted
thing call pleasure. come no surprise. Pleasure isn't just
pleasure. serves adaptive role, adaptive role relates fact
every species primary goal make otherwise go
extinct. process making sexual reproduction closely associated
sensation perception pleasure. no surprise not
highest density sensory receptors around genitalia, process
reproduction evokes sensations molecules perceptions associated
pleasure. currency pleasure exists multiple chemical systems
primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure
work required achieve ability experience pleasure, serotonin
system closely related immediate experience pleasure.
dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated
serotonin system biochemically circuit level meaning areas
brain body manufacture lot serotonin, usually not always, usually
contain neurons also manufacturer make use molecule oxytocin.
chemicals together create sensations warmth, well being, safety. dopamine
molecule closely associated hormones like testosterone
molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

pleasure pain, just briefly precursor
relevant conversation having, might want wary
experience, experience, no matter arrives,

01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure
system kicked high gear, absolutely spectacular event, cannot
ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole


system reward motivation talked beginning episode.
might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,
incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids
accomplishments, don't want every time. sure will

order get elevated levels SAMe. Now, like turn attention completely
non drug, non supplement related approach dealing pain. one
existed thousands years. recently Western scientific
community started pay serious attention to, started pay serious
attention it. terrific mechanistic science now explain
acupuncture can work well treatment certain forms pain. Now, first off,
want tell told director Chief Pain Division
Stanford School Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, people respond
well acupuncture others not. challenge identifying who'll
respond well won't respond well. Now, say won't respond well,
doesn't necessarily mean responded negative way, bad
them, appear fraction people experienced tremendous pain relief
acupuncture others experience none little point
seek forms treatment. science still ongoing.
actually excellent paper published Journal American Medical
Association, one premier medical clinical journals. basically reinforced
idea responders non-responders. number laboratories
started explore acupuncture works. one premier laboratories
Qiufu Ma's lab Harvard Medical School. Qiufu spent many years studying pain
system system related pain system, system controls
sensation itch. Just brief aside itch, itch pain often co
associated one another. recently Texas, will tell you,
mean mosquitoes. small, whatever injecting skin. Well,
talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch
mosquito bites. scratch mine scratch yours, scratch
mosquito bites. that, histamines released. gets red
inflamed itch even worse. inflammation actually caused histamine.
Well, experience inflammation pain itch call pyrogenic
experience. pain nociception, essentially, know pain
aficionado always get little upset say, oh, no thing
pain receptor, no susceptive receptors pain subjective experience. Yes,
acknowledge that. fluency, just think pain certain experience
itch separate experience, often exist together mosquito
bites call painful, least not pleasant. didn't just itch,
also painful nuts itch brings inflammation inflammation often
brings pain relief, can also bring sensation pain. itch
pain two separate phenomenon. actually discovered really
interesting phenomenon relates something actually consumed
supplement form, tropical legume. actually bean called Mucuna

bean, legume bean 99% L-DOPA. dopamine rather
precursor dopamine people buy stuff take counter ways
increase levels dopamine. make feel really dopamine doubt, meaning
makes feel little high really motivated really energetic lot like
drugs will that. don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens.
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make feel good. crash really hard take
it. outside bean compound makes people itch. remove
take supplement form. fact, usually capsule form,
outside bean, like hairy bean. little hairs contain compound,
actually used study identify itchy receptors skin.
don't time go details itch, pretty interesting
compounds nature can make us itch. Inside dopamine.
mean, really weird, plant compounds really powerful. don't let anyone
tell something's plant earth not powerful.
powerful plant herb compounds. Mucuna prurien one


dopamine inside itchy stuff outside. Now,
acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab not just identified itch pathway,
pruritus genes called, causes itch pyrogenic phenomenon
itch separate pain. lab also studied acupuncture causes relief of,
also can exacerbate pain. Now, form acupuncture explored one
commonly use called electroacupuncture. isn't just putting little needles
different parts body. needles able pass electrical current, not
magically, little wire going back device can pass
electrical current. found. study published journal neuron
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, high stringency. Qiufu Ma's lab found
electroacupuncture provided abdomen, stomach area,
creates activation called sympathetic ganglia. nothing
sympathy emotional sense stress response. Sympa just
means together. activated bunch neurons along spinal cord.
activation neurons evolves neural adrenaline something called NPY
neuropeptide Y. long short stimulating abdomen
electroacupuncture either anti-inflammatory cause inflammation.
actually exacerbate inflammation depending whether not low high

DMV low intensity stimulation, electroacupuncture hind limbs activated
DMV activated adrenal glands, sit top kidneys cause

correctly, anti-inflammatory reduce symptoms pain. can think
accelerate wound healing activations catecholaminergic pathways can
accelerate wound healing well. takeaway


thousands years millions subjects involved explorations
electroacupuncture acupuncture, Western medicine starting come
start explore underlying mechanism. Now, love acupuncture
real proponents it, worked you, might say, well, Western
medicine even need come this? even exploring this?
relieved starting happen now

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,

squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find

talking now subjective experience pain, whatever injected
skin felt like extreme mosquito bites ever had, not
biting me, not injecting venom, boy, Texas mosquitoes


make itch. it? Well, venom creates little packets so-called
histamine travel around packets called mast cells, little packets
histamine go location make presumably want scratch

rub skin area, provide pressure nearby it, activate so-
called fibers, bigger wires neurons innovate, meaning jut

01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids

C fibers so-called Melzack Wall Gate Theory Pain like look
learn further. Now, talk phenomenon long
intrigued perplexed people probably thousands years. redheads.
may heard redheads higher pain threshold
individuals. indeed, true. now study looked
mechanistically. gene called MC1R gene. MC1R gene encodes
number different proteins. proteins course related
production melanin. redheads often not always, often fair
skinned. Sometimes freckles, not always. course red hair.
people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates
something talked podcast episode hunger
feeding POMC. POMC stands pro-opiomelanocortin POMC cut
up. cleaved different hormones, including one enhances pain perception.
melanocyte stimulating hormone. another one blocks pain beta

phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.

Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us

01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin

experience pleasure. So, along lines, talk pleasure.
cells tissues machinery related pain, might think entire touch

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got

friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine

autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening

say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not

years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.
produce endogenous opioids. Now course not taken
mean redheads can tolerate pain therefore subjected
pain, means threshold pain average, not them,
average shifted higher individuals. remains determined
whether not light skin, light haired individuals also heightened level


pain threshold. mention mentioned ice bath course

good me, choice whatever is. can distract yourself.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.
conditions good greater cause fighting suffering
larger purpose. existed largely realm psychology even
motivational literature kind thing, real mechanistic basis it.
Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us
lean challenge. challenges can infection, can physical pain, can

primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure

dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole

not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

people really intense ginger's not psychologically emotionally intense perhaps
too, meaning hair very, red. Others, lighter red. course
variation here, gene, MC1R gene associated pathway relates

interesting. allows buffer pain response. personal
anecdote share red head heightened levels pain tolerance
phenomenon. Obviously not redhead. don't dye hair, partner many
years red head still red head. bright red hair since
childhood. Well, fortunate experience becoming friends Wim Hof
family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.
think people never done ice bath getting 30 seconds
minute tolerable, takes effort. takes willpower take
overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.
produce endogenous opioids. Now course not taken
mean redheads can tolerate pain therefore subjected
pain, means threshold pain average, not them,
average shifted higher individuals. remains determined
whether not light skin, light haired individuals also heightened level


pain threshold. mention mentioned ice bath course

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure
pain. Now, future episode going go deep relationship
pleasure pain, just briefly precursor
relevant conversation having, might want wary
experience, experience, no matter arrives,

01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure
system kicked high gear, absolutely spectacular event, cannot
ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole

might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,
incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful

lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain

obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce

PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal

01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin

experience pleasure. So, along lines, talk pleasure.
cells tissues machinery related pain, might think entire touch

good percentage devoted that. good percentage also devoted

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure

ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole

might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will

not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids
accomplishments, don't want every time. sure will

pleasure. currency pleasure exists multiple chemical systems
primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure
work required achieve ability experience pleasure, serotonin

dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated
serotonin system biochemically circuit level meaning areas

molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure
pain. Now, future episode going go deep relationship
pleasure pain, just briefly precursor
relevant conversation having, might want wary
experience, experience, no matter arrives,

01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure
system kicked high gear, absolutely spectacular event, cannot
ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole


system reward motivation talked beginning episode.
might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,
incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

family. actually came visit us series seminars bay area.
2016, recall. partner, never done ice bath.
never done kind real cold water exposure experience before, one particular
gathering often case women's around, ice bath
number people getting thing. actually dinner event.

overcoming pain barrier 'cause little bit painful. Not lot. people can
stay longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. incredible
without desire compete anybody else, partner redhead got
ice bath just like sat 10 minutes. fact, one point just kind turned
said, "I don't really feel pain. not really pain." Wim loved this. Wim
thought great. thought terrific thing world. got
back ice bath became fast friends, think probably still fast
friends. event, end one. call anecdata example.
Anecdata not really term use much 'cause N one anecdotes
just that. just anecdotes. described many times various
clinics anesthesiologists, observation coaches, et cetera, redheads men
women redheads seem higher pain threshold.
seem body naturally produces ways counter pain response.

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not

01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine

huge number different ways one that. One
interesting ways actually really good scientific data come
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. actually looked love particular,
experience obsessive love actually counter pain response, not just
redheads, everybody. study just briefly describe involved
people come laboratory experience one number different painful
stimuli, selectively recruited subjects new relationships
high degree infatuation much people couldn't stop
thinking communicating new partner 80% waking time,
lot. constant obsessing partner correlated with. wasn't
causal necessarily, correlated ability sustain higher levels pain
people typical non obsessive forms love, longstanding
relationships, wasn't long obsessive love rather. course study,
lot good control groups. included distractor, included people
obsessing things, pet, et cetera. included forms love
attachment, seem certain patterns thinking can allow us buffer
pain response. not surprising. Certain forms
thinking associated release particular neuromodulators particular
dopamine. dopamine, may seem kind thing underlies everything,
not. Dopamine molecule associated novelty expectation, motivation,
reward. talked beginning episode, really
molecule expectation motivation hope excitement
associated receival reward. Well, dopamine coursing throughout


brain heightened levels coursing throughout body heightened levels
fall love. probably adaptive mechanism ensure paired bonding
people knows, maybe ensured not bonding multiple people.
Nobody really knows dopamine functions terms pair bonding, known
people fall love, new relationships create high levels dopamine.
probably mechanistic basis people able buffer pain
response thinking partner new relationship almost
obsessively obsessively. Now raises deeper question always
asking. Yeah, how, how? Well, dopamine system can powerful effects
inflammation system. doesn't mysterious ways.
interacting brainstem neurons innervate spleen
areas body, deploy cells go combat infection, inflammation, pain.
ways dopamine can modulate pain, case, particular
study transform experience pain. Maybe even something pleasureful
not mysterious. really activation brainstem neurons communicate
areas body, deploy things like immune cells. instance,
neurons brain stem can modulated release dopamine
neurons brainstem control release immune cells tissues like spleen
organs like spleen. immune cells can go combat infection.
heard happy, better able combat infection, deal
pain, deal sorts things essentially makes us resilient. not
dopamine magic molecule, dopamine affects particular
circuits tells neuro-biological way biochemical way tells cells
circuits conditions good. Despite fact pain body conditions
good. love conditions good. want experience.
conditions good greater cause fighting suffering
larger purpose. existed largely realm psychology even
motivational literature kind thing, real mechanistic basis it.
Dopamine molecule can bind receptor sites brain areas.
brain areas can modulate organs tissues body can allow us
lean challenge. challenges can infection, can physical pain, can
long bouts effort required us. think many people described
feeling newly love heightened level energy, capacity
anything. mean, whole concept muse one individual


thing either imagined real enters life can use fuel. fuel

01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin

experience pleasure. So, along lines, talk pleasure.
cells tissues machinery related pain, might think entire touch
system designed allow us detect pain avoid tissue damage well,
good percentage devoted that. good percentage also devoted
thing call pleasure. come no surprise. Pleasure isn't just
pleasure. serves adaptive role, adaptive role relates fact
every species primary goal make otherwise go

reproduction evokes sensations molecules perceptions associated
pleasure. currency pleasure exists multiple chemical systems
primary ones dopamine system, anticipation pleasure
work required achieve ability experience pleasure, serotonin
system closely related immediate experience pleasure.
dopamine serotonin stem hormones molecules, things like
oxytocin, associated pair bonding. Oxytocin closely associated
serotonin system biochemically circuit level meaning areas
brain body manufacture lot serotonin, usually not always, usually
contain neurons also manufacturer make use molecule oxytocin.
chemicals together create sensations warmth, well being, safety. dopamine
molecule closely associated hormones like testosterone
molecules involved pursuit effort order get whatever
potentially cause release dopamine.

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

01:55:40 Contextual Control Pleasure Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton
individual variation. don't want say antidepressants always bad.
Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined
individual. Things like PEA subtle effect. mention PEA
supplementation something number people use short-lived.
half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal
noise. means riding around really high dopamine, first,
everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much
bigger event, novel, exciting order achieve sense
experiencing pleasureful. relationship pleasure
pain. Now, future episode going go deep relationship
pleasure pain, just briefly precursor
relevant conversation having, might want wary
experience, experience, no matter arrives,

01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure
system kicked high gear, absolutely spectacular event, cannot
ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole


system reward motivation talked beginning episode.
might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,
incredible experience. start called habituate attenuate,
yet pain increases size. preservative function keeping us
safe, believe not. just described actually basis not all,
forms addiction something will deal future episode depth.
think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids

01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor Tyrosine)



broad strokes, no pun intended description pleasure system.
course, molecules well. One particular interesting
something called PEA. PEA, stands Phenethylamine sometimes also referred
Phenethylamine depending live, pronounce
doesn't really matter. PEA molecule, incredibly potent augmenting
increasing activity certain cells neural circuits relate pleasure
system. PEA purportedly thought released response ingestion
things like certain forms dark chocolate. people take supplement form.
bit stimulant, also seems heighten perception pleasure response
particular amount dopamine serotonin. instance, kind arbitrary
experiment units type example, given experience evokes particular amount
serotonin dopamine gives rise subjective experience pleasure say
level three 10, ingestion PEA prior experience can increase
rating experience pleasureful. Maybe four five, even six.
PEA known present say releases stimulated number
different compounds, dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame certain
people can actually increase amount PEA released. glutamate
related molecules like aspartame things glutamate pathway can increase
PEA release. people will actually take PEA supplement form
mild stimulant properties well increasing perception of, ability
experience pleasure. not sledgehammer. not like dopamine itself. People
take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA drugs abuse, certainly don't
recommend things like cocaine amphetamine experience tremendous increases
dopamine, not much increases serotonin. people will take serotonin
precursor form like 5HTP serotonin itself, take amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. not saying things recommendations increasingly one sense
pleasure, describing generally falls two
categories. first category raise foundation, call tonic level
dopamine serotonin. levels serotonin dopamine low, becomes
almost impossible experience pleasure. so-called anhedonia. also
described depression. Although needn't long-term depression. certain drugs
like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion commonly called so-called
SSRI, serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft similar will
increase dopamine serotonin respectively. not increasing peaks


molecules. call acute release molecules,
raising overall levels molecules. raising sort
foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high
enough, kind way think tonic levels dopamine
serotonin. Now, us fortunately, not problems baseline
autonic levels dopamine serotonin release. Things like PEA case will
cause slight increase

tide make ability certain experiences increase dopamine
available. call neurosciences so-called gain control. can kind
turn volume, bring us closer threshold activate certain circuits.
really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write

really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.

common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.
treatments sort described minute ago might right you.
Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes
get lack motivation go seek things like food. People don't get much interest
food 'cause serotonin levels already up. Again, ton

Sometimes saved lives. saved millions lives. Sometimes people
side effects make not right choice. determined

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases
dopamine. remember, time raise baseline, reduce so-called signal

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic

foundation tide will, think mood pleasure rather
like boat, shore can't get sea, unless tide high

really mean say neuromodulator, okay?
happy something, say friends. really excited.
Maybe depending live going area world right
now, like niece locked quarantine long time recently
deemed safe. got go summer camp. never seen kid
happy spend friends. excited really amazing see
excited was. baseline levels dopamine clearly much
saw friends, literally started squealing. squealing,
squealing. Everyone squealing. wasn't squealing. admit
squealing. wasn't squealing, delight see sure made
dopamine levels go up, was, just excited anything
everything felt like exciting stimulus. pleasure, right? don't want write
off experience neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite opposite.
really beautiful see principle different experiences
experience pleasure different things. Seeing friends first time,
summer camp kid, whatever might happen use currency,
dopamine use currency serotonin. principle hope listening
podcast even repetitive features one episode next.
hoping will start embed mind brain body use
common currencies different experiences. yes, dopamine serotonin,


say dopamine serotonin levels low, will hard
achieve pleasure experience physical pleasure emotional pleasure kind.

Obviously can't determine right you. also side effects.
artificially increase molecules associated pleasure, oftentimes

half-life molecule brief, effect lasts 20
minutes so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead longer baseline increases

everything will start seem exciting like niece seeing friends first
time. Everything's exciting. will happen dopamine levels
return normal levels, will take much greater dopamine increase much

chemical, physical, emotional, combination, might want wary letting
dopamine go high certainly want wary going low.
way circuits adjust. Basically every time pleasure

ecstatic. mirror symmetric activation pain system. might seem
like evil curse biology, not. actually way protect whole


system reward motivation talked beginning episode.
might sound great just ingest substances engage behaviors just
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, just constantly motivated, system will
eventually crash. happens big increase dopamine,
also will get big increase circuits underlie sense disappointment
re adjusting balance. repeated exposure high levels dopamine,
not naturally occurring wonderful events, really high chemically induced peaks
dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks dopamine. happens
peaks dopamine start go response same,

think all?

02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Time

think pleasure think pain?
much pleasure? Well, going differ person person, extent
one can access pleasure repeatedly time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, means pleasure system
tuned well can continue experience pleasure. However, find
engaging behavior again, achieving less less
pleasure it, chances want adjust often engage
behavior. adjust expectation reward every time engage
behavior. mean that? Well, beginning episode talked
dopamine will allow us get bouts hard work. will work hard
pursue reward, really dopamine does. reward
comes doesn't increase dopamine. fact, dopamine levels go down. One
key things can adjust ability experience pleasure engage
intermittent reward schedule. can either adjust peak dopamine,
meaning not let ever get happy, no fun, right? Life
occasionally achieving experiencing ecstasy, every while, remove
reward. course, don't mean ecstasy drug separate matter.


MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities

MDMA trials separate matter. interesting, want clear. meant
psychological physical ecstasy natural sort. immense interest
going MDMA trials, just clarity purposes, separate topic
will cover episode soon. adjust dopamine system? Well,
every random, not predictable way, remove reward
will keep dopamine system tune proper ways. gain
dopamine system, say, will adjusted can continue experience
dopamine serotonin actually get reward. can translated
huge number different domains, want give examples sure
many asking, wait, actually mean? Okay, say
student, student academia, student physical
practice. Every something really well, maybe even
just showing practice rather pat back, just tell
yeah, minimum expected me. everyone's excited
something doing, maybe excited it, try adjust
excitement little bit. know might seem counterintuitive, preserving
ability experience excitement variety contexts. say get big monetary
award. Well, great. happy you. wonderful. However,
little bit wary care dopamine system care
ability get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
effort, want able maintain ability exert effort, well,
probably wouldn't want run immediately buy something
monetary reward. words, wouldn't want layer dopamine release,
okay? might, might not. might skip it. find
motivation essentially infinite. described beginning episode.
again, dopamine currency. like days hear lot
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, USs dollars, Euros stuff.
currency use body doesn't matter external currency
are. fact, watch value different currencies go whether not
cryptocurrency standard currency, value actually reflective dopamine
exists inside people. excitement particular currency crypto
otherwise really just dopamine. currency use. no
negotiating that. just way built. Now, give yet examples.
say teaching people something something


exceptionally well. reward every single time. particular, reward
something even greater experience did.
say kids win soccer game ecstatic. jumping place.
super excited reward even bigger experience,
celebration, actually inhibiting ability perform set activities
led win if, really want underscore reward every time.
course reward kids
accomplishments, don't want every time. sure will
