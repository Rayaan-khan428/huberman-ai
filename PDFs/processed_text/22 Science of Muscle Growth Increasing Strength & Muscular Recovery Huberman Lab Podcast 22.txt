Huberman Lab Podcast fourth final episode month
skills athletic performance. Now, previous episode, talked


science-based particular neuroscience-based tools accelerating fat loss. Previous
that, talked ways improve skill learning, motor movements also
included things like music piano playing not just athletic performance.
also exploring aspects physical performance throughout entire month.
Today want talk something vitally important not just athletic
performance, entire life indeed longevity, muscle.
Now, many you, hear word muscle think muscle growth building big
muscles. will touch muscle hypertrophy muscle growth today,
science-based protocols enhance hypertrophy, will mainly talking muscle
relates nervous system. can't emphasize enough whole reason
brain can move. one things exquisite
fantastic human brain, can direct sorts different kinds
movement, different speeds movement, movement different durations. can train
musculature lift heavier heavier objects can train musculature
take us so-called endurance. can also build smoothness
movement, excuse me, smoothness movement well speed movement,
suppleness movement. governed relationship nervous
system, neurons connections muscle. hear science
muscle muscle hypertrophy, might think, oh, well not interested building
muscle muscle many critical things. important movement. important
metabolism. muscle not just muscle size quality
muscle, real thing, higher metabolism is, indeed healthier
are. turns jumping ability ability stand quickly get off
floor quickly one predictive markers aging biological aging no
surprise governed brain muscle connection. addition, muscle
musculature vital posture don't talk posture enough.
told need sit straight stand straight, posture vitally important
rest body works. vital breathe. actually even vital
alert sleepy are. going talk musculature posture.
also going talk muscle relates aesthetic things. Now,
linked. Muscle metabolism, movement, posture aesthetics course linked,
right? posture changes, aesthetic changes. posture aesthetic
changes, move changes. improve muscle quality whether not
increasing muscle size not, changes way entire system not just


nervous system muscular system immune system
organs body work. today, always going talk little bit
mechanism. going explain neurons control muscle going
look muscle metabolism, muscle uses energy. promise make
simple. actually going keep brief probably 10 minutes total.
end 10 minutes, will understand lot neuromuscular
connection, brain nervous system control muscle
muscles work. going talk muscles use energy can
change use energy sake getting stronger, like also increasing
size so-called hypertrophy muscle improving endurance well
improving posture move generally. will touch nutritional
themes relates muscle particular specific amino acid
available bloodstream frequently enough, sufficient levels, can help
build improve quality muscle. talk specific exercise regimes
well course, supplementation things can enhance neuromuscular
performance overall. also going talk recovery. Recovery everybody
knows, things improve. neurons get better controlling muscle,
muscle grows, muscle gets flexible. None actually
happens training. happens training lot confusion
optimize recovery measure whether not recovered
ready come back another neuromuscular training session. talk
well. Today going lot protocols going come away
lot understanding move, work

00:12:45 Muscle Slave Nervous System

get word broadly podcast. thank support.
people, hear word muscle just think strength.
course muscles involved everything do. involved speaking,
involved sitting standing up, involved lifting objects, including
ourselves. absolutely essential maintaining breathe.
absolutely essential ambulation, moving, skills kind.
think muscle, don't just want think muscle meat muscle,
controls muscle. no surprise controls muscle nervous system.
nervous system three main nodes control areas control.
talked previous podcast. will keep brief.
Basically, upper motor neurons motor cortex. skull
involved deliberate movement. decide going pick
pen put down, right now, upper motor neurons
involved generating movement. upper motor neurons send signals
spinal cord two categories neurons. One lower motor
neurons lower motor neurons send little wires call axons
muscles cause muscles contract. dumping chemicals onto


muscle. fact, chemical acetylcholine. talked acetylcholine
brain vitally important focus actually can gait neuroplasticity,
brain's ability change response experience. neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released motor neurons way way muscles can
contract. Now, another category neurons spinal cord called central
pattern generators CPGs. involved rhythmic movements. Anytime
walking something don't think
deliberately, just happening reflexively central pattern generators motor
neurons. Anytime something deliberately, top-down control call it,
upper motor neurons comes takes control system. really
simple. got three ingredients. got upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons rhythmic movements reflexive, also got central
pattern generators. terrifically simple system level, going
focus today system can control muscle ways make system
better. Now, say better, want specific. goal build larger
muscles, way use nervous system trigger hypertrophy increase
size muscles. indeed controlled nervous system. can
forget idea muscles memory muscles grow response
something just happening within muscle, nerve muscle connection
actually creates hypertrophy. talk exactly optimize process.
addition, want improve endurance improve flexibility suppleness
explosiveness, accomplished way nervous system engages
muscles specifically. means ask going
take control upper motor neurons, central pattern generators, lower
motor neurons three order get end point

00:16:22 Brain

nervous system controls muscle. neurophysiology 101. give one
piece history important know. Sherrington, won Nobel prize
called movement, final common path. say that? Well, whole reason
nervous system whole reason brain can
control movements dedicated ways. one reasons, perhaps
predominant reason human brain large. might think, oh large


thinking creativity. Ah, no look amount real estate brain
devoted different aspects life, mainly vision, ability see
movement, ability engage lots different kinds movements. Slow
movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera. animals don't ability
don't mental real estate. don't neural real estate
brain. neuromuscular junctions. central pattern generators
don't incredible upper motor neurons can direct activity
muscles specific ways. can feel blessed system.

00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition

today going teach use system toward particular end points.
decide going direct muscles particular movement
kind. Whether not weightlifting exercise, whether yoga movement
simply picking putting pen, engaging flexors extensors
body covered flexors extensors over. instance, bicep
flexor tricep extensor. called antagonistic muscles.
move limbs opposite directions. bring wrist closer
shoulder, flection using bicep. move wrist away
shoulder, extension, using tricep. without getting lot detail
way nerves brain wired muscle make flexor
activated, nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto muscle activate
biceps, triceps inhibited. prevented engaging. ways bypass
typical mode action. converse also true tricep
activated, move wrist away shoulder bicep inhibited.
flexors like abdominal muscles. extensors lower back.
Many probably know probably don't spine
flexors move basically chin toward waist. has,
abdominal muscles among others. extensors move chin,
basically back like looking toward ceiling. extensors.
muscles stabilizing muscles things sort
movements flection extension, fact call reciprocally
innovated mutual inhibition, hear different language around characteristic
limb movements. hamstring quadriceps, hamstring brings


ankle closer back towards glutes. Basically lifting heel almost
always done toward back. Whereas quadriceps extensor opposite
hamstrings. get idea. flexors extensors neurons
control flexors extensors allow us move particular ways.

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving
function another cell type called astrocytes glial cell type.
involved clearance debris brain, involved formation
synopsis connections neurons brain. put simply,
exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain

getting lactate shuttled muscles engaging burning sensation
advantageous health tissues. So, mentioned burn

lactate. process lactate acting buffer fuel positive hormonal
signal tissues, occurs oxygen. feel burn,
definitely want focus breathing point. time take
deep inhales try bring oxygen system. definitely not time
hold breath. ever run point feeling burn
exercised way treadmill bike whatever, felt burn,
held breath, feels much intense. breathing bring


lactate site able allow lactate act buffer, fuel,

many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific
Goal

offsetting strength loss distributed nerve muscle connections.
ever area practical science confused, controversial,
almost combative times, issue best train. suppose
thing even barbed wire conversation best eat
health. seem two common areas online battle scientific
literature lot say things. Again, sources
tell Professor Andy Galpin colleagues. know
excellent people field, really trust work. controlled
studies. spent lot time space really exciting just
last three years so, tremendous amount information come
practical steps one can take order maximize benefits
resistance exercise kind. going talk going talk
research. will provide links, couple in-depth tutorials
Dr. Galpin, well papers information tell stems
from. lot information saying need move weights 80
90% one rep maximum 70%, cycle three weeks go


moderate weights. lot paths people say lot
ways add numbers get 100. near infinite number ways add
different numbers get 100. clear now literature
transpired especially literature last three years,
know roughly one repetition maximum, maximum amount weight can
perform exercise one repetition good form, full range motion,
clear moving weights using bands using body weight, instance
30% 80% one-rep maximum. going beneficial range terms
muscle hypertrophy strength. muscle growth strength. will
bias moving weights 75%, 80% range maybe even going
85 90%, going bias improvements towards strength gains.
true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing
towards hypertrophy people like call muscle endurance.
little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition
maximums, doesn't really seem matter sake hypertrophy, except far
ends really trying bias strength. Now, clear, however one
needs perform sets failure can't perform another repetition good
form near failure. sorts interesting nomenclature
popping internet. scientific, not
scientific supposed perceive close failure, et
cetera. interesting principles relate nerves
connect muscles strongly predict whether not exercise

00:54:25 Many Sets Per Week Maintain Grow Muscle & Get Stronger

performing will beneficial not. goes.
individuals untrained meaning resistance exercise
anywhere zero, probably two years, although people, might
zero one year, so-called beginners. sort untrained.
people, key parameter seems perform enough sets given exercise
per muscle per week. also true people training one
two years more. differs many sets perform depending whether


not trained untrained. say somebody
resistance exercise kind off years decide want get
serious sake sport offsetting age related declines strength,
range sets order improve strength activate cascades muscle
ranges anywhere two, believe not 20 per week. Again, sets per
week don't necessarily performed weight training
session. will talk numbers sessions. appears five sets per week
30% 80% one repetition maximum range, getting close failure,
occasionally actually going full muscular failure, isn't really full muscular failure,
inability generate contraction muscle move weight good form.
go deeper moment. five sets per week required just
maintain muscle. think that. somebody kind averse
resistance training, going lose muscle size strength. metabolism will
drop. posture will get worse. Everything context nerve muscle
conductivity will get worse time, unless generating five sets
30% 80% one repetition maximum per week. means
typical person hasn't done lot weight training, need least five sets
per muscle group. Now, just maintain. huge range
goes way 15

00:56:43 10% Resistance Training “Failure”, Rest End
“Near” Failure

case, 20 sets per week. Now, many sets perform going
depend intensity work perform. gets little bit
controversial think nowadays people agree Dr. Galpin confirmed 10%
not confused 10% discussed earlier, 10% sets given
workout 10% workouts overall high-intensity sort one
actually working muscular failure. Now say not true muscular failure
theory concentric movement kind lifting weight,
ecentric portion muscle contraction, lowering.
ecentric movements way muscle fibers lengthen sliding act
myosin talked before, always stronger lowering something
lifting it. point training sets


not failure. reason allows volume work
without fatiguing nervous system depleting nerve muscle connection
ways detrimental. can make simple. Perform anywhere 5 15
sets resistance exercise per week, per muscle, 30%
80% one-repetition maximum. seems scientifically
supported way offsetting decline muscle strength working kind

start get 10 15 set range. Now, caveat
everyone varies muscles vary terms recover ability. Depending
well can control contraction muscles deliberately. can actually figure
sort marching, might take five minutes just kind March across

way point can generate hard contraction. may move
limb order this, way. not talking just mentally contracting
bicep without moving wrist. talking without weight hand
band resistance. can generate high intensity contraction using
upper motor neuron lower motor neuron pathways muscle, might think,
well perform many sets. actually, opposite true. can
generate high-intensity muscular contractions using brain, using neurons,
will take fewer sets order stimulate muscle maintain stimulate
muscle order grow get stronger. efficient recruiting motor
units, remember, Henneman's size principle recruit men motor units
isn't just muscles, nerve muscle connections. better
that, will recruit so-called high threshold motor units ones

think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive

learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal

that, talked ways improve skill learning, motor movements also
included things like music piano playing not just athletic performance.
also exploring aspects physical performance throughout entire month.
Today want talk something vitally important not just athletic
performance, entire life indeed longevity, muscle.
Now, many you, hear word muscle think muscle growth building big
muscles. will touch muscle hypertrophy muscle growth today,
science-based protocols enhance hypertrophy, will mainly talking muscle
relates nervous system. can't emphasize enough whole reason
brain can move. one things exquisite
fantastic human brain, can direct sorts different kinds
movement, different speeds movement, movement different durations. can train
musculature lift heavier heavier objects can train musculature
take us so-called endurance. can also build smoothness
movement, excuse me, smoothness movement well speed movement,
suppleness movement. governed relationship nervous
system, neurons connections muscle. hear science
muscle muscle hypertrophy, might think, oh, well not interested building
muscle muscle many critical things. important movement. important
metabolism. muscle not just muscle size quality
muscle, real thing, higher metabolism is, indeed healthier
are. turns jumping ability ability stand quickly get off
floor quickly one predictive markers aging biological aging no
surprise governed brain muscle connection. addition, muscle
musculature vital posture don't talk posture enough.
told need sit straight stand straight, posture vitally important
rest body works. vital breathe. actually even vital
alert sleepy are. going talk musculature posture.
also going talk muscle relates aesthetic things. Now,
linked. Muscle metabolism, movement, posture aesthetics course linked,
right? posture changes, aesthetic changes. posture aesthetic
changes, move changes. improve muscle quality whether not
increasing muscle size not, changes way entire system not just


nervous system muscular system immune system

00:12:45 Muscle Slave Nervous System

get word broadly podcast. thank support.
people, hear word muscle just think strength.
course muscles involved everything do. involved speaking,
involved sitting standing up, involved lifting objects, including
ourselves. absolutely essential maintaining breathe.
absolutely essential ambulation, moving, skills kind.
think muscle, don't just want think muscle meat muscle,
controls muscle. no surprise controls muscle nervous system.
nervous system three main nodes control areas control.
talked previous podcast. will keep brief.
Basically, upper motor neurons motor cortex. skull
involved deliberate movement. decide going pick
pen put down, right now, upper motor neurons
involved generating movement. upper motor neurons send signals
spinal cord two categories neurons. One lower motor
neurons lower motor neurons send little wires call axons
muscles cause muscles contract. dumping chemicals onto


muscle. fact, chemical acetylcholine. talked acetylcholine
brain vitally important focus actually can gait neuroplasticity,
brain's ability change response experience. neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released motor neurons way way muscles can
contract. Now, another category neurons spinal cord called central
pattern generators CPGs. involved rhythmic movements. Anytime
walking something don't think
deliberately, just happening reflexively central pattern generators motor
neurons. Anytime something deliberately, top-down control call it,
upper motor neurons comes takes control system. really
simple. got three ingredients. got upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons rhythmic movements reflexive, also got central
pattern generators. terrifically simple system level, going
focus today system can control muscle ways make system
better. Now, say better, want specific. goal build larger
muscles, way use nervous system trigger hypertrophy increase
size muscles. indeed controlled nervous system. can
forget idea muscles memory muscles grow response
something just happening within muscle, nerve muscle connection
actually creates hypertrophy. talk exactly optimize process.
addition, want improve endurance improve flexibility suppleness
explosiveness, accomplished way nervous system engages
muscles specifically. means ask going
take control upper motor neurons, central pattern generators, lower
motor neurons three order get end point

00:16:22 Brain

nervous system controls muscle. neurophysiology 101. give one
piece history important know. Sherrington, won Nobel prize
called movement, final common path. say that? Well, whole reason
nervous system whole reason brain can
control movements dedicated ways. one reasons, perhaps
predominant reason human brain large. might think, oh large


thinking creativity. Ah, no look amount real estate brain
devoted different aspects life, mainly vision, ability see
movement, ability engage lots different kinds movements. Slow
movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera. animals don't ability
don't mental real estate. don't neural real estate
brain. neuromuscular junctions. central pattern generators
don't incredible upper motor neurons can direct activity
muscles specific ways. can feel blessed system.

00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition

today going teach use system toward particular end points.
decide going direct muscles particular movement
kind. Whether not weightlifting exercise, whether yoga movement
simply picking putting pen, engaging flexors extensors
body covered flexors extensors over. instance, bicep
flexor tricep extensor. called antagonistic muscles.
move limbs opposite directions. bring wrist closer
shoulder, flection using bicep. move wrist away
shoulder, extension, using tricep. without getting lot detail
way nerves brain wired muscle make flexor
activated, nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto muscle activate
biceps, triceps inhibited. prevented engaging. ways bypass
typical mode action. converse also true tricep
activated, move wrist away shoulder bicep inhibited.
flexors like abdominal muscles. extensors lower back.
Many probably know probably don't spine
flexors move basically chin toward waist. has,
abdominal muscles among others. extensors move chin,
basically back like looking toward ceiling. extensors.
muscles stabilizing muscles things sort
movements flection extension, fact call reciprocally
innovated mutual inhibition, hear different language around characteristic
limb movements. hamstring quadriceps, hamstring brings


ankle closer back towards glutes. Basically lifting heel almost
always done toward back. Whereas quadriceps extensor opposite
hamstrings. get idea. flexors extensors neurons
control flexors extensors allow us move particular ways.

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving
function another cell type called astrocytes glial cell type.
involved clearance debris brain, involved formation
synopsis connections neurons brain. put simply,
exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain

many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific
Goal

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle

more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance

00:12:45 Muscle Slave Nervous System

get word broadly podcast. thank support.
people, hear word muscle just think strength.
course muscles involved everything do. involved speaking,
involved sitting standing up, involved lifting objects, including
ourselves. absolutely essential maintaining breathe.
absolutely essential ambulation, moving, skills kind.
think muscle, don't just want think muscle meat muscle,
controls muscle. no surprise controls muscle nervous system.
nervous system three main nodes control areas control.
talked previous podcast. will keep brief.
Basically, upper motor neurons motor cortex. skull
involved deliberate movement. decide going pick
pen put down, right now, upper motor neurons
involved generating movement. upper motor neurons send signals
spinal cord two categories neurons. One lower motor
neurons lower motor neurons send little wires call axons
muscles cause muscles contract. dumping chemicals onto


muscle. fact, chemical acetylcholine. talked acetylcholine
brain vitally important focus actually can gait neuroplasticity,
brain's ability change response experience. neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released motor neurons way way muscles can
contract. Now, another category neurons spinal cord called central
pattern generators CPGs. involved rhythmic movements. Anytime
walking something don't think
deliberately, just happening reflexively central pattern generators motor
neurons. Anytime something deliberately, top-down control call it,
upper motor neurons comes takes control system. really
simple. got three ingredients. got upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons rhythmic movements reflexive, also got central
pattern generators. terrifically simple system level, going
focus today system can control muscle ways make system
better. Now, say better, want specific. goal build larger
muscles, way use nervous system trigger hypertrophy increase
size muscles. indeed controlled nervous system. can
forget idea muscles memory muscles grow response
something just happening within muscle, nerve muscle connection
actually creates hypertrophy. talk exactly optimize process.
addition, want improve endurance improve flexibility suppleness
explosiveness, accomplished way nervous system engages
muscles specifically. means ask going
take control upper motor neurons, central pattern generators, lower
motor neurons three order get end point

00:16:22 Brain

nervous system controls muscle. neurophysiology 101. give one
piece history important know. Sherrington, won Nobel prize
called movement, final common path. say that? Well, whole reason
nervous system whole reason brain can
control movements dedicated ways. one reasons, perhaps
predominant reason human brain large. might think, oh large


thinking creativity. Ah, no look amount real estate brain
devoted different aspects life, mainly vision, ability see
movement, ability engage lots different kinds movements. Slow
movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera. animals don't ability
don't mental real estate. don't neural real estate
brain. neuromuscular junctions. central pattern generators
don't incredible upper motor neurons can direct activity
muscles specific ways. can feel blessed system.

00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition

today going teach use system toward particular end points.
decide going direct muscles particular movement
kind. Whether not weightlifting exercise, whether yoga movement
simply picking putting pen, engaging flexors extensors
body covered flexors extensors over. instance, bicep
flexor tricep extensor. called antagonistic muscles.
move limbs opposite directions. bring wrist closer
shoulder, flection using bicep. move wrist away
shoulder, extension, using tricep. without getting lot detail
way nerves brain wired muscle make flexor
activated, nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto muscle activate
biceps, triceps inhibited. prevented engaging. ways bypass
typical mode action. converse also true tricep
activated, move wrist away shoulder bicep inhibited.
flexors like abdominal muscles. extensors lower back.
Many probably know probably don't spine
flexors move basically chin toward waist. has,
abdominal muscles among others. extensors move chin,
basically back like looking toward ceiling. extensors.
muscles stabilizing muscles things sort
movements flection extension, fact call reciprocally
innovated mutual inhibition, hear different language around characteristic
limb movements. hamstring quadriceps, hamstring brings


ankle closer back towards glutes. Basically lifting heel almost
always done toward back. Whereas quadriceps extensor opposite
hamstrings. get idea. flexors extensors neurons
control flexors extensors allow us move particular ways.

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving

involved clearance debris brain, involved formation
synopsis connections neurons brain. put simply,
exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain

many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances

think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

00:12:45 Muscle Slave Nervous System

get word broadly podcast. thank support.
people, hear word muscle just think strength.
course muscles involved everything do. involved speaking,
involved sitting standing up, involved lifting objects, including
ourselves. absolutely essential maintaining breathe.
absolutely essential ambulation, moving, skills kind.
think muscle, don't just want think muscle meat muscle,
controls muscle. no surprise controls muscle nervous system.
nervous system three main nodes control areas control.
talked previous podcast. will keep brief.
Basically, upper motor neurons motor cortex. skull
involved deliberate movement. decide going pick
pen put down, right now, upper motor neurons
involved generating movement. upper motor neurons send signals
spinal cord two categories neurons. One lower motor
neurons lower motor neurons send little wires call axons
muscles cause muscles contract. dumping chemicals onto


muscle. fact, chemical acetylcholine. talked acetylcholine
brain vitally important focus actually can gait neuroplasticity,
brain's ability change response experience. neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released motor neurons way way muscles can
contract. Now, another category neurons spinal cord called central
pattern generators CPGs. involved rhythmic movements. Anytime
walking something don't think
deliberately, just happening reflexively central pattern generators motor
neurons. Anytime something deliberately, top-down control call it,
upper motor neurons comes takes control system. really
simple. got three ingredients. got upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons rhythmic movements reflexive, also got central
pattern generators. terrifically simple system level, going
focus today system can control muscle ways make system
better. Now, say better, want specific. goal build larger
muscles, way use nervous system trigger hypertrophy increase
size muscles. indeed controlled nervous system. can
forget idea muscles memory muscles grow response
something just happening within muscle, nerve muscle connection
actually creates hypertrophy. talk exactly optimize process.
addition, want improve endurance improve flexibility suppleness
explosiveness, accomplished way nervous system engages
muscles specifically. means ask going
take control upper motor neurons, central pattern generators, lower
motor neurons three order get end point

00:16:22 Brain

nervous system controls muscle. neurophysiology 101. give one
piece history important know. Sherrington, won Nobel prize
called movement, final common path. say that? Well, whole reason
nervous system whole reason brain can
control movements dedicated ways. one reasons, perhaps
predominant reason human brain large. might think, oh large


thinking creativity. Ah, no look amount real estate brain
devoted different aspects life, mainly vision, ability see
movement, ability engage lots different kinds movements. Slow
movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera. animals don't ability
don't mental real estate. don't neural real estate
brain. neuromuscular junctions. central pattern generators
don't incredible upper motor neurons can direct activity
muscles specific ways. can feel blessed system.

00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition

today going teach use system toward particular end points.
decide going direct muscles particular movement
kind. Whether not weightlifting exercise, whether yoga movement
simply picking putting pen, engaging flexors extensors
body covered flexors extensors over. instance, bicep
flexor tricep extensor. called antagonistic muscles.
move limbs opposite directions. bring wrist closer
shoulder, flection using bicep. move wrist away
shoulder, extension, using tricep. without getting lot detail
way nerves brain wired muscle make flexor
activated, nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto muscle activate
biceps, triceps inhibited. prevented engaging. ways bypass
typical mode action. converse also true tricep
activated, move wrist away shoulder bicep inhibited.
flexors like abdominal muscles. extensors lower back.
Many probably know probably don't spine
flexors move basically chin toward waist. has,
abdominal muscles among others. extensors move chin,
basically back like looking toward ceiling. extensors.
muscles stabilizing muscles things sort
movements flection extension, fact call reciprocally
innovated mutual inhibition, hear different language around characteristic
limb movements. hamstring quadriceps, hamstring brings


ankle closer back towards glutes. Basically lifting heel almost
always done toward back. Whereas quadriceps extensor opposite
hamstrings. get idea. flexors extensors neurons
control flexors extensors allow us move particular ways.

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving
function another cell type called astrocytes glial cell type.
involved clearance debris brain, involved formation
synopsis connections neurons brain. put simply,
exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain
Function

getting lactate shuttled muscles engaging burning sensation
advantageous health tissues. So, mentioned burn
present lack oxygen present. hydrogen comes get
lactate. process lactate acting buffer fuel positive hormonal
signal tissues, occurs oxygen. feel burn,
definitely want focus breathing point. time take
deep inhales try bring oxygen system. definitely not time
hold breath. ever run point feeling burn
exercised way treadmill bike whatever, felt burn,
held breath, feels much intense. breathing bring


lactate site able allow lactate act buffer, fuel,
hormonal signal. reason brought today mentioned
many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people

sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf

isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause

about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can

leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal

muscle. fact, chemical acetylcholine. talked acetylcholine
brain vitally important focus actually can gait neuroplasticity,
brain's ability change response experience. neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released motor neurons way way muscles can
contract. Now, another category neurons spinal cord called central
pattern generators CPGs. involved rhythmic movements. Anytime
walking something don't think
deliberately, just happening reflexively central pattern generators motor
neurons. Anytime something deliberately, top-down control call it,
upper motor neurons comes takes control system. really
simple. got three ingredients. got upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons rhythmic movements reflexive, also got central

focus today system can control muscle ways make system
better. Now, say better, want specific. goal build larger
muscles, way use nervous system trigger hypertrophy increase
size muscles. indeed controlled nervous system. can
forget idea muscles memory muscles grow response
something just happening within muscle, nerve muscle connection
actually creates hypertrophy. talk exactly optimize process.
addition, want improve endurance improve flexibility suppleness
explosiveness, accomplished way nervous system engages
muscles specifically. means ask going
take control upper motor neurons, central pattern generators, lower
motor neurons three order get end point

00:16:22 Brain

nervous system controls muscle. neurophysiology 101. give one
piece history important know. Sherrington, won Nobel prize
called movement, final common path. say that? Well, whole reason
nervous system whole reason brain can
control movements dedicated ways. one reasons, perhaps
predominant reason human brain large. might think, oh large


thinking creativity. Ah, no look amount real estate brain
devoted different aspects life, mainly vision, ability see
movement, ability engage lots different kinds movements. Slow

don't incredible upper motor neurons can direct activity
muscles specific ways. can feel blessed system.

00:17:38 Flexors, Extensors, & Mutual Inhibition

today going teach use system toward particular end points.
decide going direct muscles particular movement
kind. Whether not weightlifting exercise, whether yoga movement
simply picking putting pen, engaging flexors extensors
body covered flexors extensors over. instance, bicep
flexor tricep extensor. called antagonistic muscles.
move limbs opposite directions. bring wrist closer
shoulder, flection using bicep. move wrist away
shoulder, extension, using tricep. without getting lot detail
way nerves brain wired muscle make flexor
activated, nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto muscle activate
biceps, triceps inhibited. prevented engaging. ways bypass
typical mode action. converse also true tricep
activated, move wrist away shoulder bicep inhibited.
flexors like abdominal muscles. extensors lower back.
Many probably know probably don't spine
flexors move basically chin toward waist. has,
abdominal muscles among others. extensors move chin,
basically back like looking toward ceiling. extensors.
muscles stabilizing muscles things sort
movements flection extension, fact call reciprocally
innovated mutual inhibition, hear different language around characteristic
limb movements. hamstring quadriceps, hamstring brings


ankle closer back towards glutes. Basically lifting heel almost
always done toward back. Whereas quadriceps extensor opposite
hamstrings. get idea. flexors extensors neurons
control flexors extensors allow us move particular ways.

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving

exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain

lactate. process lactate acting buffer fuel positive hormonal
signal tissues, occurs oxygen. feel burn,
definitely want focus breathing point. time take
deep inhales try bring oxygen system. definitely not time
hold breath. ever run point feeling burn

many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people

sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf

isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause

about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can

leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance

extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going

pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle

think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

01:59:40 Information Resources, Subscribing (Zero-Cost) Support

also want make compatible sleep, compatible work really gets

00:20:00 Muscles Move, Making & Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP

So, now heard neuromuscular physiology simplest form, want
accessible. want get just briefly, just briefly underlying
metabolism muscles use create energy. that, will
great position understand tools follow optimize
neuromuscular system particular goals. previous episode fat
loss, talked lipolysis. breakdown fat fatty acids can used
fuel. ended step got ATP, bottleneck final common
path energy producing functions body. ways basically
ATP key element there. Now muscles, don't function fats normally
going function ability move ability things
allow us move way want to, based process glycolysis,
breakdown things like glycogen glucose energy. simple
process. don't know chemistry. say words carbon
hydrogen something like that, don't freak out. don't understand
chemistry. basically happens got available sugar resource
stored muscle. glucose. glucose six carbons six waters,
basically. can broken two sets three carbons. right. basically
take glucose break two little batches carbons call
pyruvate. six divided two three. get three three pyruvate.
generates little bit ATP energy just little bit. Now, oxygen available,
sufficient oxygen there, can happen pyruvate can brought
mitochondria whole set things probably don't want hear
right now like electron transport chain citric acid cycle. happens
broken get 28 30 ATP, lot ATP. things
need know, things need know process glucose
glycogen broken pyruvate. little bit energy that.
say energy, mean ability move. fuel, literally just gets burned up.


oxygen available key within mitochondria, can create 28
30 ATP lot ATP. Now, mean? means movement
muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle
relative adipose tissue fat, can eat furnace.
just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging
so-called burn different threshold everybody, hill run will
different hill run generate burn, provided can
10% workouts individual workout, activity kind,
generating activity lactate based hormonal signal can improve
function neurons. want know aficionados improving
function another cell type called astrocytes glial cell type.
involved clearance debris brain, involved formation
synopsis connections neurons brain. put simply,
exerciser movement kind, interested allocating
movement toward enhancing brain, heart liver health, nice set
scientific data points fact

00:29:40 Breathing Properly “The Burn”— Sake Performance & Brain
Function

getting lactate shuttled muscles engaging burning sensation
advantageous health tissues. So, mentioned burn
present lack oxygen present. hydrogen comes get
lactate. process lactate acting buffer fuel positive hormonal
signal tissues, occurs oxygen. feel burn,
definitely want focus breathing point. time take
deep inhales try bring oxygen system. definitely not time
hold breath. ever run point feeling burn
exercised way treadmill bike whatever, felt burn,
held breath, feels much intense. breathing bring


lactate site able allow lactate act buffer, fuel,
hormonal signal. reason brought today mentioned
many people interested using exercise not just sake

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific
Goal

offsetting strength loss distributed nerve muscle connections.

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle

about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.

also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels

muscle metabolically expensive indeed compared tissues compared
fat, compared bone, compared almost tissues, except brain tissue muscle
metabolically demanding people muscle

just kind burn up. even didn't understand anything just said,
probably hear, hope heard oxygen around,
can create energy fuel source call glycogen glucose.
isn't oxygen around? like? Well, experienced that. not
talking oxygen environment.

00:23:29 “Burn” Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &
Hormone

talking oxygen muscle. ever carried box moving,
carrying heavy groceries car, exercising particularly hard
felt burn, well, burning people think lactic acid actually
process pyruvate, said normally converted ATP
oxygen, well, not enough oxygen 'cause muscle working
hard long, ends happening hydrogen molecule comes
get something called lactate. believe not, humans don't make lactic acid.
another species, make lactate. hear lactate bad. need
buffer burn avoid burn. lactic acid lactate prevent us
performing well able going far possibly
endurance event. Guess what, not true all. Lactate three functions,
really interesting really important. First all, buffer acidity.
don't want muscle get acidic can't function. don't want
body tissue get acidic. burn feel acidity environment
lactate people call lactic acid, again, don't make lactic acid. Lactate
buffer reduce amount burn. So, people exactly
backwards. feel burn not lactic acid, lactate present
suppress burn, suppress acidity. also fuel. feel burn, lactate
shuttled areas muscle, actual fuel burning process


absence oxygen can continue generate muscular contractions.
Now, informative 'cause also tells us burning acidity feel
can inhibit way muscles work lactate comes allows
muscles continue function. talk little bit whole
lactate thing burn means really important process. amazing
people understand exactly incorrect way. think lactic acid
bad burn bad. No, reveals number really important things going
vital molecule lactate, can reduce acidity, reduce burn well act
fuel. Now, gets really, really cool. don't enough
incentive exercise based information it'll make live
longer

00:26:11 Feeling Burn 10% Workouts Good Brain, Heart, Liver

make heart better, et cetera, reason regardless kind
exercise do, weight training, running, cycling, swimming every
while, 10% time exercise point intensity
start feel so-called burn. reason lactate shows
site burn, speak, acts hormonal signal organs
body positive way. may recall, early episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, talked hormone works.
lots different kinds hormones hormones chemicals released one
location body travel, effects lots organs body.
say lactate acts hormonal signal, mean position
influence tissues outside muscle. basically can send signals
heart, liver brain, can effects heart, liver
brain positive. just zoom second promise won't get
technical this.

00:27:30 Leveraging Lactate Enhance Brain Function

will get tools protocols really straightforward telling
feel burn particular exercise movement, burn going
buffered molecule call lactate. Lactate will provide additional fuel


additional work. good incentive provided can safely "Work
burn." burn acts beacon lactate comes allows
work. not signal stop necessarily. mean, stop
something unsafe signal lactate come allow continue
work. can act hormonal signal. Lactate can travel heart
liver brain can enhance function positive ways, not just
moments, period time follows. many people curious
can exercise make brain better. one common
questions get. telling provided can safely engaging

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing
brain. lot data speaking findings exercise
various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence
enhanced neurogenesis exercise otherwise humans. little bit,
sites within brain, dentate gyrus hippocampus,
may involved formation new memories, clear dentate gyrus
definitely involved formation new memories, whether not new neurons
added humans involved new memories. evidence
weak best, frankly whereas animals data quite strong, data
points fact hormonal signals, things transported blood
exercise beneficial brain signals not causing increase
number neurons dentate gyrus otherwise.
health connections neurons growth factors various kinds things like
IGF-1, long list things. heard exercise increases
number neurons brain, well, not true. probably good thing,
frankly always hear neurons, neurons good thing,
brain doesn't well bringing entirely new elements. hard time
negotiating making use new elements. know things
like cochlear implant deaf people given device suddenly can
hear. people really like that, deaf people really like can benefit it.
deaf people find intrusive. hard take existing neural
circuit brain incorporate lot new information it. new neurons,
great sounds neurons, neurons, actually might not best way
nervous system change modify promote longevity.
tell not great evidence new neurons past puberty,
data really show humans. sort knocked back data exercise


neurogenesis, don't let depress you. dementia family, don't
translate necessarily will develop dementia. Understand exercise
still beneficial brain aspects nervous system going
hormonal signals. Things like IGF-1, things like lactate
pathway experience burn exercise. again, don't want try
get feeling burn throughout entire episode exercise, there'll far
intense inhibit recovery. don't think it'd good performance either.

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific
Goal

offsetting strength loss distributed nerve muscle connections.
ever area practical science confused, controversial,
almost combative times, issue best train. suppose
thing even barbed wire conversation best eat
health. seem two common areas online battle scientific
literature lot say things. Again, sources
tell Professor Andy Galpin colleagues. know
excellent people field, really trust work. controlled
studies. spent lot time space really exciting just
last three years so, tremendous amount information come
practical steps one can take order maximize benefits
resistance exercise kind. going talk going talk
research. will provide links, couple in-depth tutorials
Dr. Galpin, well papers information tell stems
from. lot information saying need move weights 80
90% one rep maximum 70%, cycle three weeks go


moderate weights. lot paths people say lot
ways add numbers get 100. near infinite number ways add
different numbers get 100. clear now literature
transpired especially literature last three years,
know roughly one repetition maximum, maximum amount weight can
perform exercise one repetition good form, full range motion,
clear moving weights using bands using body weight, instance
30% 80% one-rep maximum. going beneficial range terms
muscle hypertrophy strength. muscle growth strength. will
bias moving weights 75%, 80% range maybe even going
85 90%, going bias improvements towards strength gains.
true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing
towards hypertrophy people like call muscle endurance.
little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition
maximums, doesn't really seem matter sake hypertrophy, except far
ends really trying bias strength. Now, clear, however one
needs perform sets failure can't perform another repetition good
form near failure. sorts interesting nomenclature
popping internet. scientific, not
scientific supposed perceive close failure, et
cetera. interesting principles relate nerves
connect muscles strongly predict whether not exercise

00:54:25 Many Sets Per Week Maintain Grow Muscle & Get Stronger

performing will beneficial not. goes.
individuals untrained meaning resistance exercise
anywhere zero, probably two years, although people, might
zero one year, so-called beginners. sort untrained.
people, key parameter seems perform enough sets given exercise
per muscle per week. also true people training one
two years more. differs many sets perform depending whether


not trained untrained. say somebody
resistance exercise kind off years decide want get
serious sake sport offsetting age related declines strength,
range sets order improve strength activate cascades muscle
ranges anywhere two, believe not 20 per week. Again, sets per
week don't necessarily performed weight training
session. will talk numbers sessions. appears five sets per week
30% 80% one repetition maximum range, getting close failure,
occasionally actually going full muscular failure, isn't really full muscular failure,
inability generate contraction muscle move weight good form.
go deeper moment. five sets per week required just
maintain muscle. think that. somebody kind averse
resistance training, going lose muscle size strength. metabolism will
drop. posture will get worse. Everything context nerve muscle
conductivity will get worse time, unless generating five sets
30% 80% one repetition maximum per week. means
typical person hasn't done lot weight training, need least five sets
per muscle group. Now, just maintain. huge range
goes way 15

00:56:43 10% Resistance Training “Failure”, Rest End
“Near” Failure

case, 20 sets per week. Now, many sets perform going
depend intensity work perform. gets little bit
controversial think nowadays people agree Dr. Galpin confirmed 10%
not confused 10% discussed earlier, 10% sets given
workout 10% workouts overall high-intensity sort one
actually working muscular failure. Now say not true muscular failure
theory concentric movement kind lifting weight,
ecentric portion muscle contraction, lowering.
ecentric movements way muscle fibers lengthen sliding act
myosin talked before, always stronger lowering something
lifting it. point training sets


not failure. reason allows volume work
without fatiguing nervous system depleting nerve muscle connection
ways detrimental. can make simple. Perform anywhere 5 15
sets resistance exercise per week, per muscle, 30%
80% one-repetition maximum. seems scientifically
supported way offsetting decline muscle strength working kind
five set range increasing muscle strength

00:58:23 Number Sets: Inversely Related Ability Generate High Force
Contractions

start get 10 15 set range. Now, caveat
everyone varies muscles vary terms recover ability. Depending
well can control contraction muscles deliberately. can actually figure
sort marching, might take five minutes just kind March across
body mentally try control contractions muscles deliberate
way point can generate hard contraction. may move
limb order this, way. not talking just mentally contracting
bicep without moving wrist. talking without weight hand
band resistance. can generate high intensity contraction using
upper motor neuron lower motor neuron pathways muscle, might think,
well perform many sets. actually, opposite true. can
generate high-intensity muscular contractions using brain, using neurons,
will take fewer sets order stimulate muscle maintain stimulate
muscle order grow get stronger. efficient recruiting motor
units, remember, Henneman's size principle recruit men motor units
isn't just muscles, nerve muscle connections. better
that, will recruit so-called high threshold motor units ones
hard get to, will kick off cascades things within muscle
stimulate muscle growth strength. muscles challenging
contract, going take sets order stimulate desired effect
muscles not fewer.

01:00:09 Long Weight Training Sessions Last



muscles good generating force within, going take
fewer sets. Now, many sets going determine going
depend using like 50% one-repetition maximum,

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific

true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing
towards hypertrophy people like call muscle endurance.
little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition

different training specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.
Duncan French, one directors UFC Performance Center,
graduate student University Connecticut Stores beautiful work.


colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one
set next, two minutes 120 seconds rest sets.
think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six
sets 10 repetitions led big increases serum testosterone. people
10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even
reductions testosterone. Now, important point six sets 10

things sort. done single sessions not concert bunch

feeling burn means lactate will present sending signals
brain, heart liver beneficial isolating muscles may
also generate kind lactate associated burn result
isolation muscles distinctly different. systemic versus isolated. two
general ways resistance training can applied. just wanted mention
earlier protocol well supported literature.
incorporate protocol, might ask, well, can weight training
week? sure, course can provided recovering. talk
know recovering. know muscle recovered
know whole system recovered. recovery dictates
whether not can come back work different kind. Meaning, don't


know, leg training one day, can come back
upper body training day? dictates whether not see improvement
session session all.

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six

one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides

good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going

trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre

compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.



01:20:43 Tools Determine Recovered Previous Training: Local &

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce

stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice

likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180

meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.

leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance

extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve

way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus

remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal

10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal

neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances

much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger

attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

up, maybe five, 10 minutes, like, ideally right wake order
assess well recovered therefore whether not train
whole system day. first one grip strength. Grip strength, ability
generate force level squeezing fist squeezing something, might
seem like kind trivial way assess recovery not relates
ability use upper motor neurons control lower motor neurons
generate isolated force. really assessing that.
people will use one grip tools Costello toy shaped like donut
hard rubber. tried before. working really hard, not
sleeping well, training lot one combination things,
grip suffers. can't actually squeeze thing much can Costello
born like 24 inch neck even though never touched weight somehow
can just clamp thing, can turn pancake ease
likes chuckle struggle thing. good day, can squeeze
thing eliminate hole donut speak. can also take floor scale
squeeze scale see much force can generate.
baseline establish can well rested.
morning, can see whether not able generate amount
force use rubber donut something. lot subjective
scale really trying assess whether not can generate
amount force. start seeing 10% 20% certainly reduction
concerning, means system, nervous system whole not
necessarily fatigued, pathways nerve muscle still process
rewiring order generate force. might think, well, train one


muscle group one day. hard time completely different
muscle group? doesn't make sense. something upper motor
neuron lower motor neuron pathway generally allows use something like
grip strength kind thermometer, will ability recover. look
ability generate force grip first wake up. not going good
3:00 PM cup coffee couple meals point isn't
performance overall, point assess whether not getting better, worse
day day. one really terrific

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures
capacity engage so-called parasympathetic arm nervous system
calming aspect nervous system. measures ability consciously
control particular skeletal muscle, diaphragm.
carbon dioxide tolerance test. wake morning. use
restroom first, that, try stay away phone. phone,
put airplane mode, go timer use hand watch way
measuring time, stay off social media just seconds. It'll okay.
going going inhale nose deeply can,
can lying down, sitting, whatever inhale nose exhale
way. one. going repeat four times. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times. ideally inhaling
nose exhaling mouth. just beginning carbon
dioxide tolerance test. take fifth inhale deep can
nose. Fill lungs much can, can try expand make
stomach go that, means diaphragm really engaged.


inhaling much possibly can. hit timer goal
release air slowly possible mouth. looks like
tiny, tiny little straw mouth letting go. slowly possibly can.
Measure call carbon dioxide blow off time discard rate. know can
sit lungs empty eliminate air, don't lie yourself. Don't stop
timer sitting lungs empty while, stop timer
finally no longer able exhale air. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly. just said quickly sake time
can fifth big inhale mouth, [deep exhale] not
going full duration. measuring time. carbon

minutes. Two minutes heroic carbon oxide discard time. 30 seconds
typical. 20 seconds fast. carbon dioxide discard time 20
25 seconds less, not necessarily recovered previous days activities.
ways push hold onto thought moment.
carbon oxide discard time somewhere 30 seconds 60 seconds,
call kind green zone position
physical work. carbon dioxide discard time somewhere 65
120 seconds, well almost certainly recovered nervous system.
not talking individual muscles nervous system prepared
work. Andy's Lab great data relates exercise physiology.
think story not distant future. lab using carbon
oxide discard time look anxiety recovery bouts anxiety. two totally
independent projects using measure. got HRV, requires
technology usually. got grip strength, can assess subjectively
can use floor scale now carbon dioxide tolerance. want
morning wake keep track just write little book,
maybe just keep tracking mind carbon oxide discard time. find
discard times dropping even 42nd range 52nd range,
normally can 75 seconds 120 seconds. starting drop anywhere
15% 20%, veering direction not recovering. really keen
tool everybody different recovery abilities. people eating
really well sleeping really well. people minimal stress can buffer
stress really well. people dissolve puddle tears read one text


message troubling whatever. realize, say sympathy,
realize people varying levels stress demand life. just
prescribe entire protocol says, okay, yes train today
exactly do. No, shouldn't. Use carbon dioxide discard rate
a, valuable, informative. b, zero cost c, something can track
objectively time. really key. remiss didn't say
carbon dioxide discard rate tapping ability mechanically control
diaphragm certainly one aspect it, relates direct way
ability put brake stress system.

01:32:43 Way End Every Training Session. Breath Sets
Performance

engage so-called parasympathetic calming arm autonomic nervous
system. another thing Andy Galpin's group testing offset training
run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage
parasympathetic nervous system end training. rather finish
training session just hop onto phone, serious athletes people
serious recovery initiate recovery end training
start kickstart recovery process rather measure CO2 tolerance
morning. several groups that. fact, know several groups
working using physiological size sets order
recover nervous system maintain nerve muscle contractibility. Maintain focus
throughout training session enhance focus physiological size.


double inhale, exhale sets. getting focused
intense strength work explosiveness worker, muscle isolation work
sets. sets, deliberately disengaging nervous
system, re-engaging again. just wanted emphasize that.
recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work
weight training, well exposing cold can beneficial,
not going get great benefits resistance training. words,
cold resistance training seems short circuit benefits
resistance training. things can short circuit benefits

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort
protocol non sleep depressed will link caption perhaps
use hypnosis app talked Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
great app accessing deep rest states physiological side try get
system calm training. also tools one can use reduce
inflammation kind foundational level away training. tools
talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

01:59:40 Information Resources, Subscribing (Zero-Cost) Support

00:30:47 Neurogenesis (New Neurons) & Exercise: Not Much, Humans…
Good.

improving physical health wellbeing performance, also enhancing

various kinds can increase neurogenesis, creation new neurons. Well,
unfortunate news true mice, little evidence

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,

sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause

talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids

also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting

one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve

way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like

00:33:39 Contract Muscles, Make Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s
Principle

10% total effort one exercise going give
positive effect. now know devote small portion exercise,
10% order muscle lactate benefit tissues namely heart, liver,
brain. now like shift attention use specific aspects
muscular contraction improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, well
improving muscle strength. lot reasons want get stronger.
just mention not always case getting stronger involves muscles
getting bigger. ways muscles get stronger without getting bigger.
However, increasing size muscle almost inevitably increases strength
muscle least degree. Reasons everyone want get
muscles stronger muscles generally getting progressively weaker across
lifespan. say getting stronger, not necessarily able move
increasing mounts weight gym. Although goal
discuss will relevant that, rather offset normal decline strength
posture ability generate large range movement safely, occurs
age. mentioned beginning episode just tend lose function
neuromuscular system get older. things offset
shown again, beneficial neuromuscular system protection
injury, enhancing strength bones bone density. lot
reasons use resistance exercise extend far beyond just desire increase
muscle size know many interested increasing muscle size,
many not. important principle muscle physiology called
Henneman size principle. Henneman size principle essentially says


recruit called motor units. Motor units just connections nerve
muscle pattern staircases low threshold high threshold.
means pick something light, going use minimum
amount nerve muscle energy order move thing. Likewise, pick
object heavy, going use minimum amount nerve muscle
connectivity energy order move object. basically conservation
energy principle. Now, continue exert effort movement, will happen
will tend recruit motor units time. process
recruiting neurons, lower motor neurons recall beginning
episode, lower motor neurons spinal cord actually dump
chemical acetylcholine muscle, caused muscles contract. recruit
motor units, connections lower motor neurons
muscle, start get changes muscle. open
gate potential

00:36:58 Large Range Weight (30-80% One Repetition Maximum) Can Used

muscles get stronger get larger, goal is.
way process works badly misunderstood kind online literature
weight training bodybuilding, even sports physiology. Henneman size
principle kind foundational principle within muscle physiology many people
come interpret saying way recruit high threshold motor units,
ones hard get just use heavy weights. actually not case
talk research supports weights large range sort
percentage maximum, anywhere 30% 80%. weights not
light moderately light, heavy can cause changes connections
nerve muscle lead muscle strength muscle hypertrophy. Put differently,
heavyweights can help build muscle strength not required. one
adhere certain number parameters, just couple key variables
spell you. that, can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size muscle strength want do. don't
necessarily use heavy weights order that. Now, sure power lifters
people like move heavy weights around will say, no, want get
strong absolutely lift heavy weights. might true want get


strong people interested supporting muscular
offset age related decline strength, increasing hypertrophy strength
degree, really isn't need lie Henneman size principle
many people claiming absolutely need use
heaviest weights possible

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific
Goal

offsetting strength loss distributed nerve muscle connections.
ever area practical science confused, controversial,
almost combative times, issue best train. suppose
thing even barbed wire conversation best eat
health. seem two common areas online battle scientific
literature lot say things. Again, sources
tell Professor Andy Galpin colleagues. know
excellent people field, really trust work. controlled
studies. spent lot time space really exciting just
last three years so, tremendous amount information come
practical steps one can take order maximize benefits
resistance exercise kind. going talk going talk
research. will provide links, couple in-depth tutorials
Dr. Galpin, well papers information tell stems
from. lot information saying need move weights 80
90% one rep maximum 70%, cycle three weeks go


moderate weights. lot paths people say lot
ways add numbers get 100. near infinite number ways add
different numbers get 100. clear now literature
transpired especially literature last three years,
know roughly one repetition maximum, maximum amount weight can
perform exercise one repetition good form, full range motion,
clear moving weights using bands using body weight, instance
30% 80% one-rep maximum. going beneficial range terms
muscle hypertrophy strength. muscle growth strength. will
bias moving weights 75%, 80% range maybe even going
85 90%, going bias improvements towards strength gains.
true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing
towards hypertrophy people like call muscle endurance.
little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition
maximums, doesn't really seem matter sake hypertrophy, except far
ends really trying bias strength. Now, clear, however one
needs perform sets failure can't perform another repetition good
form near failure. sorts interesting nomenclature
popping internet. scientific, not
scientific supposed perceive close failure, et
cetera. interesting principles relate nerves
connect muscles strongly predict whether not exercise

00:54:25 Many Sets Per Week Maintain Grow Muscle & Get Stronger

performing will beneficial not. goes.
individuals untrained meaning resistance exercise
anywhere zero, probably two years, although people, might
zero one year, so-called beginners. sort untrained.
people, key parameter seems perform enough sets given exercise
per muscle per week. also true people training one
two years more. differs many sets perform depending whether


not trained untrained. say somebody
resistance exercise kind off years decide want get
serious sake sport offsetting age related declines strength,
range sets order improve strength activate cascades muscle
ranges anywhere two, believe not 20 per week. Again, sets per
week don't necessarily performed weight training
session. will talk numbers sessions. appears five sets per week
30% 80% one repetition maximum range, getting close failure,
occasionally actually going full muscular failure, isn't really full muscular failure,
inability generate contraction muscle move weight good form.
go deeper moment. five sets per week required just
maintain muscle. think that. somebody kind averse
resistance training, going lose muscle size strength. metabolism will
drop. posture will get worse. Everything context nerve muscle
conductivity will get worse time, unless generating five sets
30% 80% one repetition maximum per week. means
typical person hasn't done lot weight training, need least five sets
per muscle group. Now, just maintain. huge range
goes way 15

00:56:43 10% Resistance Training “Failure”, Rest End
“Near” Failure

case, 20 sets per week. Now, many sets perform going
depend intensity work perform. gets little bit
controversial think nowadays people agree Dr. Galpin confirmed 10%
not confused 10% discussed earlier, 10% sets given
workout 10% workouts overall high-intensity sort one
actually working muscular failure. Now say not true muscular failure
theory concentric movement kind lifting weight,
ecentric portion muscle contraction, lowering.
ecentric movements way muscle fibers lengthen sliding act
myosin talked before, always stronger lowering something
lifting it. point training sets


not failure. reason allows volume work
without fatiguing nervous system depleting nerve muscle connection
ways detrimental. can make simple. Perform anywhere 5 15
sets resistance exercise per week, per muscle, 30%
80% one-repetition maximum. seems scientifically
supported way offsetting decline muscle strength working kind
five set range increasing muscle strength

00:58:23 Number Sets: Inversely Related Ability Generate High Force
Contractions

start get 10 15 set range. Now, caveat
everyone varies muscles vary terms recover ability. Depending
well can control contraction muscles deliberately. can actually figure
sort marching, might take five minutes just kind March across
body mentally try control contractions muscles deliberate
way point can generate hard contraction. may move
limb order this, way. not talking just mentally contracting
bicep without moving wrist. talking without weight hand
band resistance. can generate high intensity contraction using
upper motor neuron lower motor neuron pathways muscle, might think,
well perform many sets. actually, opposite true. can
generate high-intensity muscular contractions using brain, using neurons,
will take fewer sets order stimulate muscle maintain stimulate
muscle order grow get stronger. efficient recruiting motor
units, remember, Henneman's size principle recruit men motor units
isn't just muscles, nerve muscle connections. better
that, will recruit so-called high threshold motor units ones
hard get to, will kick off cascades things within muscle
stimulate muscle growth strength. muscles challenging
contract, going take sets order stimulate desired effect
muscles not fewer.

01:00:09 Long Weight Training Sessions Last



muscles good generating force within, going take
fewer sets. Now, many sets going determine going
depend using like 50% one-repetition maximum,
lot repetitions, might find three four, five sets will
maintain muscle. might decide one point week
again. going 10 sets week can divide among two
sessions. one session. data really show doesn't matter.
differences terms whether not trying generate
maximum intensity within workout whether not want spread out.
general, resistance workouts kind tend best favored workouts
somewhere 45 minutes 60 minutes. generally not longer 60
minutes things like cortisol inflammatory
pathways really start create situation muscle body not
great you. not hard fast rule. ax doesn't drop 60 minutes
pretty clear performing five 15 sets per week, whether not one
workout whether divided across multiple workouts really going
beneficial. please keep mind Henneman's size principle
recruitment motor units. remember better contracting particular
muscles isolating muscles, fewer sets likely need

01:01:35 Training Duration & Volume

order get desired effect. Now, people training
while? somebody weight training while, data points
fact volume can beneficial, even muscles
efficient contracting. Now, curve this, graph begins

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances

everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

everyone isn't using them, leave that. two measures however,
whether not recovered can use first thing morning wake
up, maybe five, 10 minutes, like, ideally right wake order
assess well recovered therefore whether not train
whole system day. first one grip strength. Grip strength, ability
generate force level squeezing fist squeezing something, might
seem like kind trivial way assess recovery not relates

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures
capacity engage so-called parasympathetic arm nervous system
calming aspect nervous system. measures ability consciously
control particular skeletal muscle, diaphragm.
carbon dioxide tolerance test. wake morning. use
restroom first, that, try stay away phone. phone,
put airplane mode, go timer use hand watch way
measuring time, stay off social media just seconds. It'll okay.

01:32:43 Way End Every Training Session. Breath Sets
Performance

engage so-called parasympathetic calming arm autonomic nervous
system. another thing Andy Galpin's group testing offset training
run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage
parasympathetic nervous system end training. rather finish
training session just hop onto phone, serious athletes people
serious recovery initiate recovery end training
start kickstart recovery process rather measure CO2 tolerance
morning. several groups that. fact, know several groups
working using physiological size sets order
recover nervous system maintain nerve muscle contractibility. Maintain focus
throughout training session enhance focus physiological size.


double inhale, exhale sets. getting focused
intense strength work explosiveness worker, muscle isolation work

system, re-engaging again. just wanted emphasize that.
recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work
weight training, well exposing cold can beneficial,
not going get great benefits resistance training. words,
cold resistance training seems short circuit benefits
resistance training. things can short circuit benefits

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort
protocol non sleep depressed will link caption perhaps
use hypnosis app talked Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
great app accessing deep rest states physiological side try get
system calm training. also tools one can use reduce
inflammation kind foundational level away training. tools
talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

00:38:58 Makes Muscles Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons

order build strength muscle. going explain works simple
terms. first all, just talk hypertrophy strength changes
muscle are. can make simple well. muscle
physiology class talk myofibrils sarcomeres stuff.
not going that. not purpose today's conversation.
interested well lot information going discuss
detail, highly encourage check YouTube channel writings
Dr. Andy Galpin. PhD full professor exercise physiology.
extremely knowledgeable entire area science-based tools hypertrophy,
strength hypertrophy really work. lab everything biopsy muscles,
working athletes typical folks well. lot information going
hear next 15 minutes comes extensive exploration
work colleagues done well folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic superb whole space muscle physiology
lengthy conversation Andy, Dr. Galpin prior episode. want
think muscle hypertrophy, ask changing muscles get
larger stronger. really just three ways muscles can stimulated
change. review three ways talk happens inside
muscle. three major stimulate changing way muscle works
making muscles stronger, larger, better way. stress, tension,
damage. three things don't necessarily present stress
kind exist. Something different way nerve
communicates muscle way muscle contracts performs
makes muscle need change. reminiscent neuroplasticity
brain. Something needs happen. Certain chemicals need present. Certain
processes need happen else tissue simply won't change itself.


processes events happen, tissue essentially no option except,
change. muscles move, mentioned nerves dump chemical onto
muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different
lengths. balloons place. essentially myosin looks
like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular
system appreciate begin talk specific protocols.
everything muscle hypertrophy, stimulating muscle growth
generating isolated contractions challenging specific muscles unnatural
way. Whereas strength, using musculature system moving weights,
moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate
specific nerve muscle pathways stimulate chemical signaling
transduction events muscle

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus

muscles move things called myosin actin
filaments. want read this, can look internet can put
sliding filament theory muscle contraction really want go deep
rabbit hole. interesting. can learn muscle physiology class.
basically, along length muscle have, called myosin. just think
myosin kind like wire. like bunch beads wires extend across
muscle. think simplest way describe it. myosin surrounded
little beads called actin. way muscles get bigger basically
myosin gets thicker. protein gets thicker. put mind
listening even watching YouTube, way think
whole actin myosin thing thing muscles getting bigger imagine
holding bouquet balloons, bunch balloons strings except not
holding strings bottom. bouquet isn't nicely arranged. not like
balloons top holding strings
bottom. Imagine one balloons close hand one
little bit higher up. bouquet disorganized. words, string
extending hand strings rather extending hand different

like muscle. strings call filaments, myosin
head balloon. stress muscle properly, give sufficient tension,
damage muscle just enough, adaptive response takes place
protein synthesized. specific protein, myosin. myosin
gets thicker. words, balloons get bigger. way think muscle
growth way think muscles getting stronger balloons get
bigger muscle gets thicker. Now, question always
happen? mean, muscle doesn't really know anything
happening outside world. way happens nerve, neuron tell
muscle get stronger. call signaling cascade.
talks muscle terms chemicals. doesn't whisper shout Hey, get
bigger. release certain chemicals within muscle,
certain chemicals released rather make balloons referring them,
myosin get thicker. talk stimulus that. already


mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think
research shows now every one pretty much every age sort
resistance exercise even body weight exercises order offset age-
related decline muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone
density. nothing good getting frail weak time. people
invest effort resistance exercises kind whether not
bands weights body weight, really benefit tremendously

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi


muscles, basically involved chin ups things like that, function
kinesiology standpoint move elbow back behind body.
not flexing bicep. moving elbow back behind body.
can that, mentally can physical movement moving elbow
back behind body can contract muscle hard, chances
capacity enhance strength size particular muscle
neural control muscle. key feature neuromuscular

moving resistance, moving body. specific goal hypertrophy isolate

00:48:11 Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort

muscles respond getting larger. critical distinction terms
getting stronger versus trying get muscles larger hypertrophy per se.
much isolate muscles. Muscle isolation not natural
phenomenon. not something normally do. walk don't think,
okay, right calf contract, left calf contract. No, just generate rhythmic
movements. course, no reason get stronger larger
response movements. say kind strange experiment
attaching 30 pound weights ankles. movements. Well,
weren't specifically contracting calves step, no reason
calves take bulk work. distribute work across
hip flexors aspects musculature. whole nervous system seeks
gain efficiency. seeks spread effort. can nest principle
want get stronger really moving progressively greater
loads increasing amount weight move. Whereas specifically
interested generating hypertrophy, trying generate really hard,
almost painful localized contractions muscle. Now, course, much weight
use order generate contractions will also impact hypertrophy. think


people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing

little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition

repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six

getting 10 repetitions eight seven six proper
use palmer cooling, one can 10, 10, 10, 10, even add sets. one way
one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given
muscle really isolate that, isolation work compound movement.
leg extensions thing sit extend toes

muscle group effectively. makes perfectly good sense based
Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight
can lift, maybe even form can maintain move bigger
compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre
exhausting isolation muscle compound movement. performance
compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.



01:20:43 Tools Determine Recovered Previous Training: Local &
Systemic

again, trying get faster speed movement really
matters. know recovered? can test recovery?
not just recovery resistance training, recovery running, recovery
swimming. now talking resistance training less
vacuum. haven't even touched fact many people running
resistance training swimming resistance training.
not simply case given muscle fatigued can just work muscles.
even beautifully isolated muscle, say incredible

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort

talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve

want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving

studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion

about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

mind, imagining oh goodness, balloons muscle going get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick, just going spiral control, don't worry that.
People invest ton time energy trying make muscles larger.
actually much harder people might think. want give one
exception illustrates important principle headed next.
Everybody imbalances muscles can grow. well muscles can grow,
poorly, challenging muscles grow. Now, many people
afraid like getting bulky instance, afraid lifting weights. think

00:45:22 Figuring Muscles Will Grow & Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)

whole body level systemic level well terms muscle strength.
good predictor well efficient will building strength
like size given muscle. everything upper motor
neurons involved deliberate control muscle. can actually test
right now. can just kind March across body mentally see whether not
can independently contract muscles. instance,
sitting chair standing, see whether not can contract calf
muscle just using upper motor neuron, sending signal deliberately
isolating calf muscle. can contract calf muscle hard point
muscle almost feels like starting cramp like hurts just little bit, can
extremely painful going no sensation whatsoever, chances
good upper motor neuron calf control. chances are, can isolate
call brain mind muscle connection, can contract muscles
point cramps little bit, hold decent high potential change
strength size muscle train properly. Now, hard
time that, chances won't able that. instance, focus
back muscle. Like muscles called lat. latissimus dorsi

not just recovery resistance training, recovery running, recovery
swimming. now talking resistance training less
vacuum. haven't even touched fact many people running
resistance training swimming resistance training.
not simply case given muscle fatigued can just work muscles.

everyone isn't using them, leave that. two measures however,
whether not recovered can use first thing morning wake
up, maybe five, 10 minutes, like, ideally right wake order
assess well recovered therefore whether not train
whole system day. first one grip strength. Grip strength, ability
generate force level squeezing fist squeezing something, might

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures

run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest

recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort

talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.

better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low

salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.

weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

people don't really understand mind muscle connection. sounds like great thing,
actually one things want avoid goal simply become
supple become stronger. want movements properly safely,
course opposite hypertrophy hypertrophy really trying
make particular muscle sometimes two muscles majority, not work
whereas moving force loads trying generate activity kind like lifting bar,
chin something so-called compound movements involve lot
muscle groups. goal better those, want avoid isolating one
particular muscle. Now, know probably comes across kind obvious duh,
especially folks spent lot time gym aimed getting
hypertrophy. think people don't appreciate nerve muscle
connections distinction isolating nerve muscle connections versus
distributing work nerve muscle connections, vital determining whether
not generate hypertrophy isolated nerve muscle contractions versus strength

00:50:47 Much Resistance (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) & Specific

literature lot say things. Again, sources
tell Professor Andy Galpin colleagues. know
excellent people field, really trust work. controlled
studies. spent lot time space really exciting just
last three years so, tremendous amount information come
practical steps one can take order maximize benefits
resistance exercise kind. going talk going talk
research. will provide links, couple in-depth tutorials
Dr. Galpin, well papers information tell stems
from. lot information saying need move weights 80
90% one rep maximum 70%, cycle three weeks go


moderate weights. lot paths people say lot
ways add numbers get 100. near infinite number ways add
different numbers get 100. clear now literature
transpired especially literature last three years,
know roughly one repetition maximum, maximum amount weight can
perform exercise one repetition good form, full range motion,
clear moving weights using bands using body weight, instance
30% 80% one-rep maximum. going beneficial range terms
muscle hypertrophy strength. muscle growth strength. will
bias moving weights 75%, 80% range maybe even going
85 90%, going bias improvements towards strength gains.
true. use weights 30% one-repetition maximum
40% 50% many repetitions, course, biasing
towards hypertrophy people like call muscle endurance.
little bit complicated term endurance, almost always think relating
running swimming long bouts activity. 30% 80% one-repetition
maximums, doesn't really seem matter sake hypertrophy, except far
ends really trying bias strength. Now, clear, however one
needs perform sets failure can't perform another repetition good
form near failure. sorts interesting nomenclature
popping internet. scientific, not
scientific supposed perceive close failure, et
cetera. interesting principles relate nerves
connect muscles strongly predict whether not exercise

00:54:25 Many Sets Per Week Maintain Grow Muscle & Get Stronger

performing will beneficial not. goes.
individuals untrained meaning resistance exercise
anywhere zero, probably two years, although people, might
zero one year, so-called beginners. sort untrained.
people, key parameter seems perform enough sets given exercise
per muscle per week. also true people training one
two years more. differs many sets perform depending whether


not trained untrained. say somebody
resistance exercise kind off years decide want get
serious sake sport offsetting age related declines strength,
range sets order improve strength activate cascades muscle
ranges anywhere two, believe not 20 per week. Again, sets per
week don't necessarily performed weight training
session. will talk numbers sessions. appears five sets per week
30% 80% one repetition maximum range, getting close failure,
occasionally actually going full muscular failure, isn't really full muscular failure,
inability generate contraction muscle move weight good form.
go deeper moment. five sets per week required just
maintain muscle. think that. somebody kind averse
resistance training, going lose muscle size strength. metabolism will
drop. posture will get worse. Everything context nerve muscle
conductivity will get worse time, unless generating five sets
30% 80% one repetition maximum per week. means
typical person hasn't done lot weight training, need least five sets
per muscle group. Now, just maintain. huge range
goes way 15

00:56:43 10% Resistance Training “Failure”, Rest End

case, 20 sets per week. Now, many sets perform going
depend intensity work perform. gets little bit
controversial think nowadays people agree Dr. Galpin confirmed 10%
not confused 10% discussed earlier, 10% sets given
workout 10% workouts overall high-intensity sort one
actually working muscular failure. Now say not true muscular failure
theory concentric movement kind lifting weight,

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per

Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,

01:08:10 Customizing Training; 1-6 Month Experiments; Key Elements Summarized

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance

trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really

01:08:10 Customizing Training; 1-6 Month Experiments; Key Elements Summarized

may fact case, data able access essentially
described just moment ago. probably starting realize need

not first suggest people periodize training. things
anywhere one month six months, see goes make

fact need get sufficient volume, need least five sets maintain
probably need 10 sets per muscle group order improve muscle.

different training specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.
Duncan French, one directors UFC Performance Center,

colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one
set next, two minutes 120 seconds rest sets.
think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six
sets 10 repetitions led big increases serum testosterone. people
10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even
reductions testosterone. Now, important point six sets 10

theme really want bring forward today weight training resistance

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six
minutes can beneficial. interested expanding volume work

one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given
muscle really isolate that, isolation work compound movement.
leg extensions thing sit extend toes
toward ceiling. Leg extensions squats will allow squats target
muscle group effectively. makes perfectly good sense based
Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight
can lift, maybe even form can maintain move bigger
compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre
exhausting isolation muscle compound movement. performance
compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.

different training specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.
Duncan French, one directors UFC Performance Center,
graduate student University Connecticut Stores beautiful work.


colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one
set next, two minutes 120 seconds rest sets.
think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six
sets 10 repetitions led big increases serum testosterone. people
10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even
reductions testosterone. Now, important point six sets 10
done big compound movements. things like squats, deadlifts, chin-ups
things sort. done single sessions not concert bunch
exercise, although athletes that, no reason couldn't
also types training elsewhere week. asked Duncan

neuroscientist, amazing six sets 10 repetitions

isolation muscles distinctly different. systemic versus isolated. two
general ways resistance training can applied. just wanted mention

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really

one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given

leg extensions thing sit extend toes

Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight

compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre

thus far explosive movements hypertrophy-based training provided training
60 minutes less will cause increases serum testosterone shown

different training specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.
Duncan French, one directors UFC Performance Center,
graduate student University Connecticut Stores beautiful work.


colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one
set next, two minutes 120 seconds rest sets.
think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six
sets 10 repetitions led big increases serum testosterone. people
10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even
reductions testosterone. Now, important point six sets 10
done big compound movements. things like squats, deadlifts, chin-ups
things sort. done single sessions not concert bunch
exercise, although athletes that, no reason couldn't
also types training elsewhere week. asked Duncan
mentioned done twice week probably maximum anyone
still maintain increase testosterone. interesting protocol
neuroscientist, amazing six sets 10 repetitions
something, causes distinctly different result terms hormone output 10 sets
10 exact movement. speaks exquisite way nerve

theme really want bring forward today weight training resistance
training kind really used either systemic effects. 10% training done
feeling burn means lactate will present sending signals
brain, heart liver beneficial isolating muscles may
also generate kind lactate associated burn result
isolation muscles distinctly different. systemic versus isolated. two
general ways resistance training can applied. just wanted mention

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six
minutes can beneficial. interested expanding volume work

one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given

leg extensions thing sit extend toes

Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight

compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre

one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like

Duncan French, one directors UFC Performance Center,

colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one

think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six
sets 10 repetitions led big increases serum testosterone. people
10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even

done big compound movements. things like squats, deadlifts, chin-ups
things sort. done single sessions not concert bunch
exercise, although athletes that, no reason couldn't
also types training elsewhere week. asked Duncan
mentioned done twice week probably maximum anyone
still maintain increase testosterone. interesting protocol
neuroscientist, amazing six sets 10 repetitions
something, causes distinctly different result terms hormone output 10 sets
10 exact movement. speaks exquisite way nerve
muscle connections dictate whole physiology entire system.
theme really want bring forward today weight training resistance
training kind really used either systemic effects. 10% training done
feeling burn means lactate will present sending signals
brain, heart liver beneficial isolating muscles may
also generate kind lactate associated burn result
isolation muscles distinctly different. systemic versus isolated. two
general ways resistance training can applied. just wanted mention

incorporate protocol, might ask, well, can weight training
week? sure, course can provided recovering. talk
know recovering. know muscle recovered
know whole system recovered. recovery dictates
whether not can come back work different kind. Meaning, don't


know, leg training one day, can come back
upper body training day? dictates whether not see improvement
session session all.

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six
minutes can beneficial. interested expanding volume work

getting 10 repetitions eight seven six proper
use palmer cooling, one can 10, 10, 10, 10, even add sets. one way
one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given
muscle really isolate that, isolation work compound movement.
leg extensions thing sit extend toes
toward ceiling. Leg extensions squats will allow squats target
muscle group effectively. makes perfectly good sense based
Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight
can lift, maybe even form can maintain move bigger
compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre
exhausting isolation muscle compound movement. performance
compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.

no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,

people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak

also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance

extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal

colleagues found ideal training protocols stimulating testosterone release
something many people want variety reasons.
involved six sets 10 repetitions even requires lightening weight one

think pretty short rest pretty darn hard work. Now, interesting
limited threshold increasing testosterone. protocol six

10 sets 10 just four repetitions per set, testosterone not increase.
fact, got catabolic cortisol like pathway. get benefits
so-called 10 sets 10 protocol, not testosterone increase maybe even

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six
minutes can beneficial. interested expanding volume work

one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given
muscle really isolate that, isolation work compound movement.
leg extensions thing sit extend toes
toward ceiling. Leg extensions squats will allow squats target
muscle group effectively. makes perfectly good sense based
Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight
can lift, maybe even form can maintain move bigger
compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre
exhausting isolation muscle compound movement. performance
compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.



01:20:43 Tools Determine Recovered Previous Training: Local &

again, trying get faster speed movement really
matters. know recovered? can test recovery?
not just recovery resistance training, recovery running, recovery

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel

damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere

block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion

seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids

leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve

way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal

01:16:00 Quickly Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times & Activities; Pre-
Exhaustion

talk recovery just want make sure nailed details
able extract literature conversation Dr. Galpin.
wondering quickly perform repetitions sake hypertrophy strength gains,
anywhere half second per repetition way eight seconds per
repetition, doesn't seem matter. Again, thinking explosiveness
building speed, specifically using resistance training build endurance,
separate matter. talked explosiveness speed. talk endurance
moments. also talked set contractions called selfie
effect people flexing particular muscle, isolating particular muscle sets,
just want mention terrible thing goal performance
sets. moving particular amount weight. actually going diminish
amount weight can move. going enhance muscle growth going
enhance nerve muscle isolation particular pathway. again, flexing
sets going favor hypertrophy, not performance. trying get
stronger, trying move weights, trying distribute work,
trying maybe skill training resistance flexing sets absolutely
wrong thing obvious reasons fatiguing muscle further. Just
remaining still walking around little bit shown beneficial terms
moving lactate muscle well just recovering sets.
Now, long recover sets, question. testosterone protocol,
Duncan French colleagues found two minutes keeping really
clock, two minutes not longer. hypertrophy strength gains,
seem resting anywhere two minutes even three four, even five six
minutes can beneficial. interested expanding volume work

getting 10 repetitions eight seven six proper
use palmer cooling, one can 10, 10, 10, 10, even add sets. one way
one can accomplish higher volume work without drop weight
considerably. can hit really sweet spot goal
getting strong generating hypertrophy. soon drop
lighter weights, shifting towards hypertrophy endurance less
toward strength given muscle. check episode. last thing besides
set contractions whether not distributing work whether not
really trying isolate muscles notion pre-exhausting muscles.
shown instance, want generate force given
muscle really isolate that, isolation work compound movement.
leg extensions thing sit extend toes
toward ceiling. Leg extensions squats will allow squats target
muscle group effectively. makes perfectly good sense based
Henneman's size principle fatiguing motor units. obvious
case. course going anti performance terms much weight
can lift, maybe even form can maintain move bigger
compound movement. really ask number questions.
good isolating given muscle? Therefore, many sets want do?
often willing train therefore, many sets going
given session versus many going distribute across week?
aiming performance? going distribute work across nervous system
musculature? trying move weights? trying challenge muscles?
trying challenge muscles, really want focus things like pre
exhausting isolation muscle compound movement. performance
compound movements will absolutely suffer ability isolate muscle
generate hypertrophy accumulation larger myosin, bigger balloons,
will benefit.



01:20:43 Tools Determine Recovered Previous Training: Local &

again, trying get faster speed movement really
matters. know recovered? can test recovery?
not just recovery resistance training, recovery running, recovery
swimming. now talking resistance training less
vacuum. haven't even touched fact many people running
resistance training swimming resistance training.
not simply case given muscle fatigued can just work muscles.
even beautifully isolated muscle, say incredible

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce

like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle

about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.

leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance

extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training

remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely

run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort

talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles

kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

01:20:43 Tools Determine Recovered Previous Training: Local &
Systemic

again, trying get faster speed movement really
matters. know recovered? can test recovery?
not just recovery resistance training, recovery running, recovery
swimming. now talking resistance training less
vacuum. haven't even touched fact many people running
resistance training swimming resistance training.
not simply case given muscle fatigued can just work muscles.
even beautifully isolated muscle, say incredible
abilities isolate just quadriceps instance workout
isolate quadriceps six sets intense work maybe use palmer
cooling, able 12 sets intense work done, muscle
group next day certainly not going recovered unless somebody
extraordinary recovery enhancing recovery chemical means
talk end. Well, can assess systemic recovery meaning
nervous system. nervous system's ability generate force distributed
isolated three main tests. fortunately, tests simple two
essentially zero cost, require no equipment. HRV, heart rate variability
made way finally forefront exercise physiology even popular
discussion. talked HRV before. exhale, heart rate slows
way diaphragm connected heart brain
way brain connected heart. inhale heart rate speeds
basis heart rate variability. Heart rate variability good. means
breathing properly, say good means want lot heart
rate variability. don't want heart rate high low consistently time.
might come bit surprise endurance athletes, probably trying
accomplish endurance work steady cadence really hit nice sweet spot
breathing rhythmically, heart rate's going rhythmically.
steady heart rate, away exercise, nice low heart rate
say. Well, nice low heart rate isn't necessarily always nice. Turns introducing
bouts increasing heart rate exercise even waking day,
stressful events even provided brief beneficial. good nerve heart


system benefits able increase heart rate decrease heart rate. Heart
rate variability good. don't want high heart rate, don't want low heart rate
time. heart rate variability difficult lot people measure.
devices will allow that. Various watches devices.
devices becoming available time. Hopefully soon, integrated
phone involve no contact anything body. carry
costs not perfect yet. measures heart rate variability one
can use movement still phase say technology development
everyone isn't using them, leave that. two measures however,
whether not recovered can use first thing morning wake
up, maybe five, 10 minutes, like, ideally right wake order
assess well recovered therefore whether not train
whole system day. first one grip strength. Grip strength, ability
generate force level squeezing fist squeezing something, might
seem like kind trivial way assess recovery not relates
ability use upper motor neurons control lower motor neurons
generate isolated force. really assessing that.
people will use one grip tools Costello toy shaped like donut
hard rubber. tried before. working really hard, not
sleeping well, training lot one combination things,
grip suffers. can't actually squeeze thing much can Costello
born like 24 inch neck even though never touched weight somehow
can just clamp thing, can turn pancake ease
likes chuckle struggle thing. good day, can squeeze
thing eliminate hole donut speak. can also take floor scale
squeeze scale see much force can generate.
baseline establish can well rested.
morning, can see whether not able generate amount
force use rubber donut something. lot subjective
scale really trying assess whether not can generate
amount force. start seeing 10% 20% certainly reduction
concerning, means system, nervous system whole not
necessarily fatigued, pathways nerve muscle still process
rewiring order generate force. might think, well, train one


muscle group one day. hard time completely different
muscle group? doesn't make sense. something upper motor
neuron lower motor neuron pathway generally allows use something like
grip strength kind thermometer, will ability recover. look
ability generate force grip first wake up. not going good
3:00 PM cup coffee couple meals point isn't
performance overall, point assess whether not getting better, worse
day day. one really terrific

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures
capacity engage so-called parasympathetic arm nervous system
calming aspect nervous system. measures ability consciously
control particular skeletal muscle, diaphragm.
carbon dioxide tolerance test. wake morning. use
restroom first, that, try stay away phone. phone,
put airplane mode, go timer use hand watch way
measuring time, stay off social media just seconds. It'll okay.
going going inhale nose deeply can,
can lying down, sitting, whatever inhale nose exhale
way. one. going repeat four times. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times. ideally inhaling
nose exhaling mouth. just beginning carbon
dioxide tolerance test. take fifth inhale deep can
nose. Fill lungs much can, can try expand make
stomach go that, means diaphragm really engaged.


inhaling much possibly can. hit timer goal
release air slowly possible mouth. looks like
tiny, tiny little straw mouth letting go. slowly possibly can.
Measure call carbon dioxide blow off time discard rate. know can
sit lungs empty eliminate air, don't lie yourself. Don't stop
timer sitting lungs empty while, stop timer
finally no longer able exhale air. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly. just said quickly sake time
can fifth big inhale mouth, [deep exhale] not
going full duration. measuring time. carbon

minutes. Two minutes heroic carbon oxide discard time. 30 seconds
typical. 20 seconds fast. carbon dioxide discard time 20
25 seconds less, not necessarily recovered previous days activities.
ways push hold onto thought moment.
carbon oxide discard time somewhere 30 seconds 60 seconds,
call kind green zone position
physical work. carbon dioxide discard time somewhere 65
120 seconds, well almost certainly recovered nervous system.
not talking individual muscles nervous system prepared
work. Andy's Lab great data relates exercise physiology.
think story not distant future. lab using carbon
oxide discard time look anxiety recovery bouts anxiety. two totally
independent projects using measure. got HRV, requires
technology usually. got grip strength, can assess subjectively
can use floor scale now carbon dioxide tolerance. want
morning wake keep track just write little book,
maybe just keep tracking mind carbon oxide discard time. find
discard times dropping even 42nd range 52nd range,
normally can 75 seconds 120 seconds. starting drop anywhere
15% 20%, veering direction not recovering. really keen
tool everybody different recovery abilities. people eating
really well sleeping really well. people minimal stress can buffer
stress really well. people dissolve puddle tears read one text


message troubling whatever. realize, say sympathy,
realize people varying levels stress demand life. just
prescribe entire protocol says, okay, yes train today
exactly do. No, shouldn't. Use carbon dioxide discard rate
a, valuable, informative. b, zero cost c, something can track
objectively time. really key. remiss didn't say
carbon dioxide discard rate tapping ability mechanically control
diaphragm certainly one aspect it, relates direct way
ability put brake stress system.

01:32:43 Way End Every Training Session. Breath Sets
Performance

engage so-called parasympathetic calming arm autonomic nervous
system. another thing Andy Galpin's group testing offset training
run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage
parasympathetic nervous system end training. rather finish
training session just hop onto phone, serious athletes people
serious recovery initiate recovery end training
start kickstart recovery process rather measure CO2 tolerance
morning. several groups that. fact, know several groups
working using physiological size sets order
recover nervous system maintain nerve muscle contractibility. Maintain focus
throughout training session enhance focus physiological size.


double inhale, exhale sets. getting focused
intense strength work explosiveness worker, muscle isolation work
sets. sets, deliberately disengaging nervous
system, re-engaging again. just wanted emphasize that.
recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work
weight training, well exposing cold can beneficial,
not going get great benefits resistance training. words,
cold resistance training seems short circuit benefits
resistance training. things can short circuit benefits

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort
protocol non sleep depressed will link caption perhaps
use hypnosis app talked Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
great app accessing deep rest states physiological side try get
system calm training. also tools one can use reduce
inflammation kind foundational level away training. tools
talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures
capacity engage so-called parasympathetic arm nervous system
calming aspect nervous system. measures ability consciously
control particular skeletal muscle, diaphragm.
carbon dioxide tolerance test. wake morning. use
restroom first, that, try stay away phone. phone,
put airplane mode, go timer use hand watch way
measuring time, stay off social media just seconds. It'll okay.
going going inhale nose deeply can,

01:32:43 Way End Every Training Session. Breath Sets
Performance

engage so-called parasympathetic calming arm autonomic nervous
system. another thing Andy Galpin's group testing offset training
run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage
parasympathetic nervous system end training. rather finish
training session just hop onto phone, serious athletes people
serious recovery initiate recovery end training
start kickstart recovery process rather measure CO2 tolerance
morning. several groups that. fact, know several groups
working using physiological size sets order
recover nervous system maintain nerve muscle contractibility. Maintain focus
throughout training session enhance focus physiological size.


double inhale, exhale sets. getting focused
intense strength work explosiveness worker, muscle isolation work
sets. sets, deliberately disengaging nervous
system, re-engaging again. just wanted emphasize that.
recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work
weight training, well exposing cold can beneficial,
not going get great benefits resistance training. words,
cold resistance training seems short circuit benefits
resistance training. things can short circuit benefits

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort
protocol non sleep depressed will link caption perhaps
use hypnosis app talked Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
great app accessing deep rest states physiological side try get
system calm training. also tools one can use reduce
inflammation kind foundational level away training. tools
talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection

01:26:33 Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test Assessing Recovery

Andy Galpin's group using. delighted relates
something lab excited well carbon dioxide tolerance.
really interesting tool endurance athletes, strength athletes think can benefit
from. fact athletes people kinds. Even not athlete, even
not exercising all, good question whether not system whole
okay not. rely thermometer. fever not? rely
subjective things. feel good not? digesting well not?
subjective. carbon dioxide tolerance test is, objective measures
capacity engage so-called parasympathetic arm nervous system
calming aspect nervous system. measures ability consciously
control particular skeletal muscle, diaphragm.
carbon dioxide tolerance test. wake morning. use
restroom first, that, try stay away phone. phone,
put airplane mode, go timer use hand watch way
measuring time, stay off social media just seconds. It'll okay.
going going inhale nose deeply can,
can lying down, sitting, whatever inhale nose exhale
way. one. going repeat four times. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times. ideally inhaling
nose exhaling mouth. just beginning carbon

nose. Fill lungs much can, can try expand make
stomach go that, means diaphragm really engaged.


inhaling much possibly can. hit timer goal
release air slowly possible mouth. looks like
tiny, tiny little straw mouth letting go. slowly possibly can.
Measure call carbon dioxide blow off time discard rate. know can

timer sitting lungs empty while, stop timer
finally no longer able exhale air. inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly. just said quickly sake time

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce

like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-

type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope

supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change
muscles. want talk things support process nerve
muscle communication touch things lot people
try "enhance workouts" evaluate whether not fact


enhancing workouts not. weight training, unlike lot forms
exercise unique aspect it, feature guess people call
pump fact blood goes muscle train,
gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

engage so-called parasympathetic calming arm autonomic nervous

run, weight training session, maybe even plyometrics
session, didn't really talk jumping throwing sort thing. Maybe
talk future episode. groups, including elite
athletes groups interested physical performance using
tool deliberately disengaged five minutes end training.
deliberately engage calming parasympathetic arm nervous system.
can number different tools. big fan respiration tools
'cause always available you. breathing always there. talk
tools previous episodes use things like non sleep deep rest
SDR end training session. 10 physiological size, double inhales
nose followed long exhales, will definitely engage
parasympathetic nervous system end training. rather finish
training session just hop onto phone, serious athletes people
serious recovery initiate recovery end training
start kickstart recovery process rather measure CO2 tolerance
morning. several groups that. fact, know several groups
working using physiological size sets order
recover nervous system maintain nerve muscle contractibility. Maintain focus

recovery complex process.

01:34:46 & Use Cold Exposure Enhance Recovery; Avoid
Cold

got lot things CO2 tolerance set valuable tool. Now, another
tool recovery people excited use cold ice bath.
important. somebody uses cold cold shower, ice
bath, jumping lake, river whatever used generate cold
recovery tool, aware data starting emerge
goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce
amount delayed muscle soreness one readout intense damaging given
workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work
weight training, well exposing cold can beneficial,
not going get great benefits resistance training. words,
cold resistance training seems short circuit benefits

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,
hypertrophy muscle, et cetera. anti-histamines can problem. Obviously don't
compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel
bloodstream little packets burst open sites inflammation. Muscle
damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many
people take. mentioned previous episode can interfere
benefits endurance training benefits resistance training. addition that,
block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes
pain. non-steroid anti-inflammatory NSAIDs called, anti-
histamines seem prevent lot gains improvements endurance, strength
size people specifically using exercise for. cautious use
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

01:38:42 Foundational Supplements Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium
Malate

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try
get state reduced inflammation. sort
protocol non sleep depressed will link caption perhaps
use hypnosis app talked Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
great app accessing deep rest states physiological side try get
system calm training. also tools one can use reduce
inflammation kind foundational level away training. tools
talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change

goal recovery strength improvements, using cold within four hours following
workout. not talking palmer cooling, talking whole body cooling
cooling neck down. Yes, will reduce inflammation. Yes, will reduce

workout not readout, seem interfere things
like mTOR pathways, mammalian target rapamycin pathway pathways
related inflammation promote muscle repair muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, damage stimulus nerve muscle connections change
muscles get bigger, stronger, better. getting ice
bath training taking really cold shower resistance training,
likely short-circuiting improvements trying create. Now, athletes
trying recover quickly can get back training sessions,
say somebody doesn't really want gain much strength hypertrophy
mainly focused endurance want endurance work

01:36:37 Antihistamines & Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Problematic/Prevent


Progress

resistance training well. One anti-histamines. interesting data
published recently. believe scientific reports, yes showed anti-
histamines can prevent benefits cardiovascular exercise endurance
type work running, swimming fairly long duration even sprint type work, well
inhibit processes associated resistance training. Remember,
resistance training endurance training, stimulus stress adaptation
stress get better. can run further, faster, lift weight,

compromise ability breathe completely, anti-histamines generally work
blocking called mast cells M-A-S-T. Mast cells really interesting cells
talk month neuro immune function. travel

damage inflammation signal something needs change. taking
histamines appears can disrupt inflammatory process. actually
want inflammation immediately workout, want bring
inflammation later mention that. thing non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs know trade names. painkillers many

block pain signals pain good signal might something
wrong. nobody likes pain, suppose probably
people like pain, different story nobody likes

especially within four hours preceding four hours following exercise. hope
starting get picture. order change nerve muscle connectivity


ways will better serve you, need stressor actual training
particular stressor depends training goals. stressor almost always
going associated inflammation, training, want try

talked many times before, just restate again. kind Golden
Three according Andy Galpin ones recommends sufficient omega-
3s again, can accomplished diet, whole food intake
supplementation both. general, getting 1,000 milligrams EPA per day
keep inflammation low relatively low. Vitamin D cases, magnesium
malate. Magnesium malate seems particularly effective offsetting delayed onset
muscle soreness. Soreness not required improvements strength,
improvements explosiveness, improvements hypertrophy. myth. Now,
experience delayed onset muscle soreness, chances stressed
particular muscle pretty well even maybe well, maybe stressed much
need longer recovery. total debate whether not
train muscle still sore. think general takeaway is, no
means not recovered. things course like massage, like fascial
release things sort sauna, cold can perhaps accelerate movement
soreness not sore. general, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium
malate trio seemed effective way reduce inflammation kind systemic
level. remember want inflammation provided not damaging muscles
much

01:41:08 Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

injured training session stimulus change

like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost

incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no
chance done that. don't think even lot training. say
want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving

studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low

different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported

weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements

seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips

conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.

01:59:40 Information Resources, Subscribing (Zero-Cost) Support

gun training actually get window result might actually look
like actually accomplish result. think go
hard run say go two mile run, say goal break
want sub ten two mile. Actually, went university running cross
country, senior year high school wanted walk cross country
team. went turned sub 10, two mile.
think best mile ever ran high school 457, isn't terrible. can't
now. not even close best high school athletes can now.
meant back-to-back. sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. told Costello story day just kind laughed me.
like, even want run two miles? Costello built almost
exclusively type two fast twitch muscles designed moving objects.
incredibly strong. since puppy. mean dog
probably drag tractor wanted to, can't really go far. Whereas Greyhound
Whippet sight hounds scent hounds can go, go, go.
higher percentage so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. much
better endurance. sub-10 two mile very, challenging, no

want improve performance given type exercise. talk
things seem work across board improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, improve nerve muscle communication performance. first
thing absolutely key nerve muscle communication physical performance
kind might not sound exciting exciting. salt.
Nerves cells, neurons communicate communicate muscle
electricity. electricity generated particular ions moving
neuron. rushing particular ion, sodium, salt allows nerve cells
fire. don't enough salt system neurons brain
nerve muscle communication will terrible. sufficient salt, will
excellent. much salt will depend much water drinking, much
caffeine drinking, much food ingesting. whether not
taking diuretics hot is, et cetera, much sweating. want


make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly

even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain

just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen

people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face

showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks

one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think

make sure enough salt, potassium magnesium system
want perform well. realized salt isn't glamorous performance tool
vital. absolutely vital. endurance athletes people train high
heat can speak fact electrolytes low, brain doesn't
function, body doesn't function nearly well. fact, even mental work,
studying writing math coding, analytic work kind,
even hard conversation important you, sufficient electrolytes really
going help low electrolytes won't help just drinking water won't help
need electrolytes.

01:45:00 Creatine: Good? Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations:
DHT

thing shown again, numerous well-controlled
studies improve muscle performance creatine. Early lot
controversy creatine many studies want, can go
website everyone now knows love free website examined.com
no fewer 18 studies there. 66 studies... 18 studies supporting
muscle creating content can increased ingesting creatine. much creatine?
Well, asked experts tell somebody 180 pounds,
five grams day sufficient so. Heavier 180, got like
220 pound 230 pound person, 10 15 grams creatine. People lighter 180
pounds maybe three five grams creatine even one three grams. Creatine
fuel source early bouts activity high intensity activity. also fuel source
neurons brain can cognitive enhancing effects. creatine
interesting molecule. Early released supplement,
thought load higher dosages days maintain
lower dosages. take 20 30 grams day back off five 10. doesn't
seem case can get benefits taking dosages low
level. just mentioned moments ago relate body weight throughout.
salt electrolytes absolutely key. need present. need well
hydrated. Creatine seems performance enhancing effect. 66
studies, 66 showing power output greatly increased anywhere 1%2 20%.
sprinting running jumping well weightlifting creatine.


ability hydrate body improved creating way brings
water cells various kinds. indirect effect, can help increasingly
mass way brings water muscle probably also
way get stronger, can generate force generate
hypertrophy. reduces fatigue. Seven studies shown reduces fatigue.
even interesting effects improving cognition traumatic brain
injury. Although serious medical condition situations absolutely talk
board certified physician adding anything taking anything
current regimen. effects interesting notable,
big ones ones referred increased power output, et cetera.
just want emphasize creatine can increase hormone talked
testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted
five alpha reductase dihydrotestosterone. dominant androgen
humans. Leads increases strength libido forth. also can increase male
pattern baldness. people, not everybody experience hair loss creatine
people don't. people experience accelerated beard growth
basically [mumbles] opposite effect hair follicles face
scalp, people don't. Women ingest creatine essentially no data
showing increases hair loss facial hair growth, course, everyone
different. can go examine.com. can explore studies. creatine
definitely powerful performance enhancing molecule. one, one
personally never tried seems strong well-supported
effects beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine interesting hear
weight training think heavy deadlifts bench presses kind stuff
people doing. beta-alanine seems support exercise slightly
longer duration. mix anaerobic aerobic type movement. physical
performance 60 242nd range. can use mind kind figure out.
Things weights limit 8 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise
sort like rowing sprinting. interval work, seems help kind work.
not talking long runs, not talking heavy deadlifts. standard
dose somewhere two five grams, again, always check doctor,
make sure things safe you. not responsible health. are.
don't say just protect me. say also protect really seems
improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.


even interesting effects reduction body fat improvements
lean mass. creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, kind core three things
seem improve performance well supported scientific literature.
earlier episode supercharging performance talked palmer cooling.
certainly performance enhancing tool. nothing ingest cooling
palms specific way. powerful.

01:50:12 Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note Arginine & Citrulline & Cold Sores

Now, longer duration bouts exercise? mainly focusing
resistance training, long runs, long swims, kinds things?
Well, seem juice ingesting things like arginine citrulline can improve
performance long bouts exercise mainly going due effects
compounds vasodilation. going open vasculature allow
blood flow. note things like citrulline arginine can side effects
will. can increase likelihood herpes cold sore outbreaks
mouth. arginine pathway don't know people know this,
herpes virus lives neurons trigeminal nerve innervates lips
eyes mucus membranes face. herpes type 1 simplex virus.
virus lives neurons periodically inflames neurons,
leads cold sores seems like arginine citrulline can lead
increases cold sores canker sores, outbreaks kinds. want
aware that. not everybody, not everybody caring HSV-1, just
aware think now 80% 90% people time 12 years old,
contracted HSV-1. contagious typically one outbreak,
conditions stress heightened arginine citrulline ingestion later.
Again, not necessarily STI, sexually transmitted infection. infection
passed easily mucous membranes, just terms touching objects

01:52:00 Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency

things sort. common general population. discussion
muscle muscle performance not adequate didn't mention something
nutrition, rather whole discussion nutrition, 'cause


lots information online, instance, want gain muscle
need calorie surplus 10 15%. calorie surplus
more. want avoid gaining weight not create calorie surplus, et
cetera. can find information online. not podcast really
about. month talked lot hormones food moods.
talked foods, relate nervous system. comes
supporting muscle. supporting synthesis larger called myosin balloons,
seem ingesting 700 3000 milligrams essential amino acid leucine
meal important. Now, not necessarily mean supplements. fact,
people recommend get protein, get amino acids, including
essential amino acids leucine whole foods. High quality proteins
aren't high density proteins. mean that? Well, true lot
sources protein found things like beans nuts things like
essential amino acids can found per unit calorie, practice,
ethics ingest animal proteins, true instance, 200 calories steak
chicken fish eggs will higher density essential amino acids
equivalent amount calories nuts plants. just simply way works.
vegans vegetarians certainly, not saying no way can
support muscle growth. absolutely can. might want supplement
leucine 700 3000 milligrams leucine per meal one best ways
shown support synthesis myosin goal hypertrophy
also way support muscle repair goal strength.
specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy strength. encourage
think protein density issue. whether not ingest animal proteins
don't, think whether not getting sufficient essential amino acids,
especially leucine. Now, many people addressed question whether not
need eat six seven times day. turns don't kind old
school thinking need eat frequently. think certain athletes
active drug assisted meaning people enhancing testosterone levels
super physiological levels, experiencing heightened levels protein
synthesis can utilize that. might make sense. Again, not supporting
use performance enhancing drugs people that.
one reasons eat frequently. much protein typical
people not that, imagine not. appear


need eat don't need eat six seven times day. seem like not
eating day also important. somewhere one meal day six
meals day, lies reasonable two three maybe four times day. think
whole discussion warranted discussion Dr.
Galpin future time whether not eating protein frequently can enhance
myosin synthesis. think simple takeaway literature able
extract discussion is, eating two four times day, making sure
getting sufficient amino acids way compatible ethics
nutritional regimen

01:55:54 Hard Workouts Can Make Hard Think/Do Mental Work

going support muscle repair, muscle growth strength improvements, et cetera, just
fine. one thing like cover relationship
particular kinds exercise ability think perform cognitive functions.
hear exercise vital brain supports brain health
body health. indeed true provided done correctly. However, many us
familiar experience going run going swim working hard
gym, not able use brain essentially useless cognitive
functions rest day. discussed Dr. Galpin morning,
learned something interesting, hard bouts exercise sort
training near failure generating focused muscular contractions,
obsession lasts anywhere from, don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
long run engaging interval training run, exercise,
reduction oxygenation brain. actually quite significant dip
amount oxygen neurons getting therefore ability think.
important control intensity duration training sessions
still able well life lean life way need to,
guessing not position just prioritize physical training also
need use minds. certainly familiar wanting get exercise

01:57:25 Leveraging Weight Training & Rest Days Optimize Cognitive Work

also requirement needing perform cognitive work throughout day. also


turns can leverage something interesting exercise nerve
muscle work ways can benefit cognitive function focus.
way body nervous system predict bouts intense focused effort.
say resistance training two three times week, maybe even four
times week consistently given time. clocks, literally
biological clocks within liver within brain learn predict focus
intense work. trying get intense cognitive work done, might try
scheduling cognitive work days don't physical training
time normally intense, focused physical training.
systems body generate acetylcholine release neuromodulators,
systems, body brain generate focused effort, sort
clock mechanism way likely will find just week training
regular times will able focus readily things not training
provided period time day normally train.
kind indirect positive effect. harnessing focus expectation
focus nervous system particular time day. course,
remiss

01:58:58 Time Day Best Resistance Train?

didn't talk time day training. turns whether not train
morning afternoon, doesn't really seem matter sake things like
hypertrophy strength, et cetera. Everyone seems time day
prefer train. said reasons based body temperature rhythms
cortisol release training 30 minutes, three hours 11 hours normal
waking time can beneficial can provide sort predictability regularity
body will ready train best apt train well. evidence
training afternoon better performance, whereas training body
composition changes strain changes, et cetera doesn't really matter train.
