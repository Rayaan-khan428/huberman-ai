dive discussion manic bipolar disorder, want highlight
recent findings area totally separate mental health think really
important everyone know about. paper published journal Cell,
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. fact, one three apex
journals. curious, papers published journal Nature,
Science Cell considered sort Super Bowl, Stanley Cup, NBA
championships publishing. paper entitled, inter-organ neural circuit
appetite suppression illustrates important principle think everyone
know about, principle so-called parallel pathways. Parallel pathways,
name suggests, pathways, neural pathways hormonal pathways
otherwise operate independently one another accomplish common goal.
paper really shows set peptides body
peptide referring today called GLP-1, Glucagon-like peptide-1,
related peptides. talked podcast two reasons. First
all, big proponent consumer yerba mate. Yerba mate tea can
promote release glucagon-like peptide-1. also new prescription
drugs now hitting market. really impressive clinical
trials diabetes obesity essentially glucagon-like peptide-1 stimulator,
stimulate release that, fact, synthetic version glucagon-like
peptide-1. glucagon-like peptide-1? peptide, small little protein,
can dramatically suppress appetite. drugs explored
showing quite impressive results things like treatment type 2 diabetes
forms diabetes, well obesity. lead weight loss. Now terms
yerba mate stimulation glucagon-like peptide-1, going much lower
amount glucagon-like peptide-1 released drinking yerba mate opposed
say, taking drug stimulates GLP-1 taking drug GLP-1. Nonetheless,
also point yerba mate comes bunch different forms.
concern certain smokey-flavored forms yerba mate carcinogenic,
avoid forms yerba mate. me, yerba mate one preferred
sources caffeine. me, like way tastes. provide sort caffeine
kick like early day focus work exercise. yet
actively avoid smoked varieties yerba mate potential carcinogenic


effects smoked varieties. Glucagon-like peptide-1, mentioned earlier, can
suppress appetite. paper shows least two mechanisms
parallel pathways. paper shows glucagon-like peptide-1 axon
receptors body portion nervous system called enteric nervous
system, E-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system. component nervous
system don't really control over, autonomic automatic. GLP-1 binds
called intestinofugal enteric neurons, don't need know name,
neurons two things. First all, cause gut distension,
actually make feel full. incredible, right? peptide, not actual physical food,
peptide stimulates neurons cause changes so-called
mechanoreceptors gut, enteric nervous system make people feel full.
can lead actually mild, suppose levels GLP-1 high, major gut
distension. think levels GLP-1 come drinking yerba mate
hopefully appropriate dosaging synthetic forms GLP-1 drugs
stimulate GLP-1 cause mild, not major, gut distension, 'cause major gut distension
uncomfortable. GLP-1 acting level gut increase gut
distension, way pathway goes gut hypothalamus,
little cluster neurons size marble sits roof mouth,
also suppressing appetite brain mechanisms. really beautiful, right?
peptide, small little protein released gut release within
gut causes gut distension, makes feel full. way neural
stimulation hypothalamus also activates neural pathways within brain
trigger satiety, feeling enough food. me, GLP-1
impressive important. Why? recent category drugs now hitting
market seems adjust obesity can help people weight loss order help
health. least two mechanisms. One within brain,
within gut communication so-called gut brain access.
again, enteric neurons communicating brain,
hypothalamus, way this, called sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-
hypothalamic pathway, absolutely not need know that. mouthful,
enough make mouth feel distended. time, things like yerba
mate, sure compounds well, certainly yerba
mate can stimulate release GLP-1. looking
mild appetite suppression want accomplish also ingesting caffeine,


yerba mate might good option that. just know operating two
mechanisms, body mild gut distension make feel full,
brain increase satiety make feel less hungry. everybody, not just
interested appetite suppression, think important understand
parallel pathways fundamental organized. Another good
example excited something positive negative,
stressful positively aroused, parallel activation
epinephrine, adrenaline, adrenals area brain called
locus coeruleus. again, see biology neuroscience
brain body acting concert. acting together
mechanisms either independent, separately brain separately
body, directed towards common goal, communication brain
body, almost always communication going bidirectional, body
brain brain body. think results really interesting really important
sake weight loss, sake appetite suppression, just generally way
illustrate important theme

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.
hypomanic state, might actually present normal us
depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear
depressed

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes

environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity

called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited

mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture
treatments, drug treatments, talk therapy treatments, lifestyle treatments,
nutraceutical, can say supplement-based treatments omega-3
supplementation full necessary picture

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus

that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene

financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing

three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows

problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

relayed me, may help sleep certain people

manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited

even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment

approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way

describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%

bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less

reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start
wane disappear people bipolar disorder circuits interoception,
understanding going one's body. can imagine sit

person may genuinely not know. ask depressed person,
depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons

treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available

biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved

causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective

next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast

combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar

said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive

three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells

cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot

suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not

people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%

shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle

miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural

bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes

things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing

talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity

episodes present. Nowadays, lot excitement psilocybin
psychedelic. US, psilocybin still illegal. not legal, meaning can get


lot trouble possessing it, certainly selling it, et cetera. psilocybin
explored clinical therapy certain laboratory settings particular, Johns
Hopkins School Medicine. explored human patients treatment
major depression, OCD believe well, certainly major depression
eating disorders. seems initial wave publications work done
incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes
bipolar. However, least knowledge, again, knowledge, not
controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis
treatment bipolar disorder, per se, data supporting use psilocybin
treatment bipolar disorder per se. realize, say that, going
number people may positive negative experiences
cannabis psilocybin relate bipolar disorder. please, willing
comfortable, put that, comfortable, comment section YouTube.


course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive
outcomes treatment bipolar disorder, please provide links PubMed ideas
those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus

that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back

like also talk not typical therapeutics bipolar disorder
also point things tried failed successful treatment

especially online communities, not clear particularly
hazardous own, although carry hazards, think
important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural

ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar
disorder family members, provided not manic

excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,

happening right now. ECT, repetitive TMS rTMS,
mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies, targeted toward depressive

incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes

bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis

treatment bipolar disorder per se. realize, say that, going
number people may positive negative experiences
cannabis psilocybin relate bipolar disorder. please, willing

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive
outcomes treatment bipolar disorder, please provide links PubMed ideas
those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria Mania

bipolar disorder people still benefit from. basically two
kinds bipolar disorder referred bipolar 1 bipolar 2. just talk
bipolar 1 first. Bipolar 1 characterized fairly extended period mania.
mania? Mania period elevated mood, energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
symptomology talk going forward. manic episode
extreme. condition energy lift, mood lift, sort
impulsivity actions words person suffering manic bipolar disorder
noticeable extreme. Now key thing, however, not always
noticeable person suffering mode. Sometimes
recognize that, sometimes don't, always highly recognizable people
person suffering manic bipolar disorder not like people. talk
bipolar 1 little bit depth. One key clinical criteria diagnostic
criteria bipolar 1 person suffer manic episodes display
manic episodes seven days more. turns key. stability
manic episode seven days turns important.
seven days, person elevated mood, expansive thought day, every day
seven days. Now lot reasons somebody manic
mode. doesn't necessarily mean somebody bipolar disorder. fact, someone
manic mode seven days still not diagnosed bipolar
disorder. Why? Well, things can create manic episodes, things like
traumatic brain injury, things like seizure, things like various prescription drugs illicit
drugs, things like amphetamine cocaine, not bipolar disorder
even though symptomology perspective, might look even identical.
think symptoms diagnostic criteria psychiatrist use
order ask whether not someone manic manic bipolar
disorder whether not person manic reason, traumatic
brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera. typically person brought clinic
person bring clinic meet psychiatrist, seems
likely directed toward psychiatrist oftentimes people


manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not

seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way

psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something

psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.

might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%

bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not

shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken

manic episode just simply won't perspective foresight bring
clinic. psychiatrist going start evaluate couple
different things. first all, going try figure whether not
person least three following symptoms. first symptom
distractibility. person distractable? going one thing next.
People manic episode will talking pen talking
something saw day something want purchase
place going travel to, et cetera, also prone
stimulus within room. Meaning bell go off sound
hallway orient that. orient clinician
orient something pocket, place. think
little bit like ADHD attention-deficit disorder, extreme. highly
distractable, highly impulsive, impulsivity relates actions. person might
fidgeting something might try leave room person might,
real world, somebody might notice person going
purchasing multiples something unusual someone purchase.
instance, happen know someone whose ex-spouse bipolar disorder
ex-spouse went bought 10 plus air fryers. mean, think unless
restaurant using lot air fryers, idea need one
two air fryers might just seem little bit norm. impulsivity can
purchasing, can things well. can booking 12 international trips one
afternoon going buying three cars, et cetera. impulsivity.
grandiosity. People manic bipolar disorder manic episode will
often display words actions grandiosity. keep mind, not lies
sense person isn't lying order try pull one anybody,
actual beliefs person comes grandiose position
world grandiose opportunities potential world. Typical forms grandiosity
manic episodes person suddenly decides going
win Pulitzer Prize. person selected win Pulitzer Prize. going
write novel afternoon, going win Pulitzer Prize year,
less delusion grandeur. idea someone one
afternoon, suppose possible realm possibilities, extremely
unlikely. forms grandiosity often present people suffering
manic episode will going run president


person believe selected citizens given country universe
president country present universe. sounds ridiculous,
sorts delusions grandiosity one condition often presents itself,
one set symptoms presents itself. Flight ideas also typical manic
episodes. little bit like distractibility, people talking
extensively one thing switching talking extensively something
else. podcast talking manic bipolar disorder
suddenly switching OCD deliberate cold exposure
role sugar impact brain, et cetera. essentially random selection
different topics exist science, happen interested
curious about, just episodes podcast one two
topics, focus fairly narrow trench discussion, somebody
flight ideas jumping categories topics kind pseudo
random way. might take off path one thing switch another
without transition transitions don't logical structure them.
aspect manic bipolar disorder often presents manic
episodes agitation. People feeling extremely physically agitated, lot shaking
moving about. can venture realm paranoia, lot agitation,
difficulty sitting still, difficulty just looking, feeling acting calm.
another condition no sleep. say no sleep, mean no sleep
minimal sleep. incredible sounds, people manic episode can
often go seven days zero sleep. key feature zero sleep
not troubled it. not thinking, oh, suffering insomnia
really, really want sleep. Sometimes case, often not,
simply not sleeping. staying 24 hours another 24 hours, just continues
entire week. Again, inconceivable us don't suffer manic
episodes. can imagine pulled apart us feel
conditions, yet just going going going no sleep, hours,
shopping, talking, running, sorts different things categories
symptoms talked before. doesn't bother not
sleeping. last sort category symptoms psychiatrist
evaluating seeing present rapid pressured speech. rapid pressured
speech something hear it, recognize it. somebody
almost seems hitting speech like machine gun fire, coming you,


coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.
hypomanic state, might actually present normal us
depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear
depressed

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder



bipolar disorder, perhaps family members person.
goal within episode now provide clear detailed picture
bipolar disorder various forms. start talk treatments bipolar
disorder neural circuit basis bipolar disorder, want make sure
distinguish bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder. will
entire episode maybe even several episodes borderline personality disorder.
Borderline personality disorder can indeed present ways resemble bipolar
disorder vice versa, key distinctions need made
turns bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder quite distinct
terms defining criteria. key distinction somebody borderline

can episodes can resemble mania hypomania. periods flights ideas,
people spending money excessively sexually promiscuous ways

00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts

person borderline personality disorder one mode next. move
discussion treatments neural circuits underlying bipolar
disorder, want just nail one key point. brief point
perhaps important point, highs lows, say
highs, manic episodes, sometimes lows, 'cause again, not everybody
bipolar disorder 1 2 suffers depressive episodes, sometimes yes, sometimes no,


particular bipolar 2, yes, people bipolar 1 can extreme manic
episodes just return normal recall. Well, extreme lows
extreme highs people bipolar disorder impact lives negative ways.
essential something going return little bit later
talk relationship bipolar disorder creativity, turns
quite strong association there, one almost lead believe
bipolar can beneficial certain contexts, yet, whole, bipolar
disorder extremely detrimental challenging person suffering it.
something want keep mind

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring
lithium. Lithium, know, periodic table elements. indeed

bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often

important point well, absolutely wonderful paper
absolutely wonderful voyage history psychiatry right discussion
just three short paragraphs, Cade really lays case lithium

01:05:05 Effects Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection

prior understanding biological basis disease treatment
needed. Now said, scientists clinicians quite rigorous trying
understand lithium works order understand
bipolar disorder. way proper medicine science done. Even
excellent treatment something, important understand
treatment works because, first all, not everyone responds treatment. Second
all, scientists physicians understand just one treatment
works, side effects all, possibility better treatments.
not just trying bypass drug doesn't make much money drug
companies, know lot people think terms, think, oh, well,
continued search better treatments bipolar disorder even though lithium works
lithium doesn't allow drug companies make much money. not really

created lithium, fact people need ongoing blood testing, et cetera, really
stimulates need, really urgent need new better treatments bipolar
disorder. understanding lithium works cellular level, neural
circuit level, et cetera, really stand find new discoveries.
literature search actions mechanisms lithium terms can calm
people reduce manic episodes, find enormous array
papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important
context neural circuits involved bipolar disorder minutes. also
seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially
relates health condition, like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always
seems discussed context inflammation bad. want point
inflammation natural adaptive response physical injury cell organ

say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain

thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken

seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy

psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something

detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way

suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.

describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.

depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear
depressed

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying

disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring

interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal

report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical

instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived

brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going

BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic

bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown

coming you, coming really no room conversation. not
offering opportunity back forth, back forth, might
ask feel something started, well, I, [speaking gibberish]
going hit another barrage paragraph information just
speech, pseudo random. got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity, flight
ideas, agitation, no sleep, rapid pressured speech. someone diagnosed
manic episode, not engaging displaying
symptoms. however need present least three symptoms,
order meet condition bipolar 1, presenting three
symptoms least seven days. longer, least seven days. Now,
seems pretty straightforward, right? one level, way describe way
exists clinical literature, think, well, pretty easy
diagnose. yet complication challenge
psychiatrist, again, determine manic episodes not due something
bipolar disorder. instance, again, TBI, traumatic brain injury,
seizures, meds sorts drugs. Corticosteroids, often
prescribed number immune conditions wound healing can also cause
manic episodes. determine everything happening meets
criteria described before, three seven symptom categories seven
days can't better explained something else going
person's life immediate medical history. important. Now,
challenge, something going come today, not just
description biology bipolar disorder, also description different
treatments treatment approaches, typically, somebody sitting front
psychiatrist, particular first time two people interacting,
psychiatrist just getting one snapshot person moment. person
day one manic episode, person might day six manic
episode, person transitioning manic episode, person
suffering combination manic episode where, impulsivity
bipolar disorder, went used illicit drugs. also used cocaine.
psychiatrist serious challenge. psychiatrist determine based
conversation, isn't blood test, isn't measurement can take
scale biomarker, use language, conversation somebody
who, accounts, pretty impaired conversation determine whether not


suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.
hypomanic state, might actually present normal us
depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear
depressed

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder



bipolar disorder, perhaps family members person.
goal within episode now provide clear detailed picture
bipolar disorder various forms. start talk treatments bipolar

Borderline personality disorder can indeed present ways resemble bipolar

00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts

person borderline personality disorder one mode next. move
discussion treatments neural circuits underlying bipolar
disorder, want just nail one key point. brief point
perhaps important point, highs lows, say
highs, manic episodes, sometimes lows, 'cause again, not everybody
bipolar disorder 1 2 suffers depressive episodes, sometimes yes, sometimes no,


particular bipolar 2, yes, people bipolar 1 can extreme manic
episodes just return normal recall. Well, extreme lows
extreme highs people bipolar disorder impact lives negative ways.
essential something going return little bit later
talk relationship bipolar disorder creativity, turns
quite strong association there, one almost lead believe
bipolar can beneficial certain contexts, yet, whole, bipolar
disorder extremely detrimental challenging person suffering it.
something want keep mind

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring
lithium. Lithium, know, periodic table elements. indeed
naturally occurring substance. actually arrived earth way star dust. Yes,
talking star dust podcast, like learn
origins lithium lithium arrived earth discovery applications

can refer to, less biology talk, certainly lot lithium
element. nerds like me, love know things came
planet one form another, encourage take brief listen
talk. going discuss lithium context applications treatment


bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,
measure amount lithium, three times day. four days, distinctly
quieter February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal. continued well
February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,
including descriptions patients suffered negative side effects.
important point well, absolutely wonderful paper

instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important

seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially
relates health condition, like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always
seems discussed context inflammation bad. want point
inflammation natural adaptive response physical injury cell organ

sense create adaptations make muscle stronger, maybe even
grow muscle, inflammatory response associated critical
positive adaptation. inflammation isn't always bad, although excessive,
say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain
particular. important. return important little bit.
thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.
can get hit really hard head, bullet, God forbid, can enter skull kill
neurons, lot reasons neurons can die. Neuroprotection situation
neuron given sort chemical physical resiliency allows
suffer insult yet bounce back. similar way think
psychological resiliency, neuroprotection ability neurons better able
handle stress different kinds, particular, excitotoxicity. phenomenon


bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible

atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start
wane disappear people bipolar disorder circuits interoception,

depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown

this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements

risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken

suffering manic episode consequence bipolar disorder.
can imagine real world, somebody says, well, long since
slept? person starts answer, oh, well, day went
basement. going get something refrigerator thought might take
nap. sudden talking something completely different.
might not even answer. psychiatrist really good
detective, benevolent detective, detective nonetheless determining whether
not symptoms existed seven days more, whether not meet
the, least three, more, least three criteria symptom
categories talked before. Now, assuming do, assuming patient
meets criteria, likely diagnosed bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1
disorder means extended manic episodes, seven days more,
not necessarily mean dropping depressive episode well.
common misconception bipolar disorder often called,
bipolar disorder referred bipolar depression, yet many people bipolar
disorder don't necessarily experience deep depressive episodes. Many do,
many not. somebody can truly diagnosed accurately bipolar
one, even though experiencing manic episodes dropping
baseline.

00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability

Manic episode, dropping baseline. important understand.
Now, second category bipolar disorder bipolar 2. BP-II bipolar disorder 2
somewhat different bipolar disorder 1. First all, characterized often
presence manic episodes, mania, depressive episodes,
referred hypomania. Now, anytime biology medicine hear hypo,
opposite hyper. got normal hyper hypo. Hypomania somewhat
suppressed level mania. not going extreme mania
typically think of. yet hypo can due duration, not intensity mania.
right. Hypomania can mean lessened intensity mania, can also used
refer shorter duration mania. fact, one key criteria bipolar
2. Bipolar 2 often diagnosed basis presence manic episodes
lasting four days even less. someone BP-II might four days


increased energy, goal-directed activity, irritable, euphoric, not
sleeping, et cetera, lasting four days.
longer extended periods mania, hypomanic episodes. not quite
intense pressured speech isn't quite pressured. impulsivity isn't quite
severe, et cetera, et cetera. aspect bipolar 2 one mentioned
briefly moment ago, often associated drops
depressive episode. people going manic episodes four days less,
dropping depression, going back normal, manic again. want point
however people bipolar 1 can indeed go manic episodes
severe, call major depression, can oscillate like sine wave, really high
highs, really low lows. important understand terms understanding
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 not always sine wave. really important
something frankly not know started researching episode talking
psychiatrists. mention, talked several board certified psychiatrists
preparation episode, give references them. fact,
going coming podcast guests future in-depth
discussion bipolar psychiatric disorders. psychiatrists spoke
confirmed saying, way bipolar disorder can
present can vary tremendously individuals. One person might go high
highs last seven days more, low lows. Bouts depression, major
depression can last two weeks more. people rapid cycling way
three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, dropping three
days depression. want erase picture mind manic bipolar
disorder sine wave, cycling mania depression.
can take lot different forms. again, serious challenge psychiatrist
diagnose people fact getting snapshot
person unless known time working
time. also especially important either bipolar
depression suspect might, know someone bipolar depression
suspect somebody might bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder.
noticing somebody manic normal, well, different
picture somebody going manic deep bouts depression.
manic deep bouts depression easier recognize
extremes highs lows. Now, might seem somewhat obvious


describe it, yet important a, frankly, citizen planet knows
human beings keep eye manic episodes, again,
whether not four days less, whether not seven days more,

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.
hypomanic state, might actually present normal us
depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear
depressed

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder



bipolar disorder, perhaps family members person.
goal within episode now provide clear detailed picture
bipolar disorder various forms. start talk treatments bipolar

Borderline personality disorder can indeed present ways resemble bipolar

00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts

person borderline personality disorder one mode next. move
discussion treatments neural circuits underlying bipolar
disorder, want just nail one key point. brief point
perhaps important point, highs lows, say

bipolar disorder 1 2 suffers depressive episodes, sometimes yes, sometimes no,


particular bipolar 2, yes, people bipolar 1 can extreme manic

extreme highs people bipolar disorder impact lives negative ways.
essential something going return little bit later

something want keep mind

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring
lithium. Lithium, know, periodic table elements. indeed
naturally occurring substance. actually arrived earth way star dust. Yes,
talking star dust podcast, like learn

planet one form another, encourage take brief listen
talk. going discuss lithium context applications treatment


bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical

can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic

bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,

fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring

talk. going discuss lithium context applications treatment


bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,
measure amount lithium, three times day. four days, distinctly
quieter February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal. continued well
February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,
including descriptions patients suffered negative side effects.
important point well, absolutely wonderful paper
absolutely wonderful voyage history psychiatry right discussion
just three short paragraphs, Cade really lays case lithium

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes

environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

00:33:07 Bipolar vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States

manic episodes really defining criteria bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar
depression. couple key features bipolar 1 bipolar 2 can
allow us get better insight whether not somebody bipolar 1 bipolar 2,
percentage time people bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend
manic state, depressed state, symptom-free state. also important
discuss turns people genuine diagnosed bipolar 1 bipolar 2
often symptom-free, can make difficult us people know
people treating people bipolar disorder identify whether not
somebody manic episode depressive episode, whether not
headed manic depressive episode. numbers studied.
paper, actually two papers, first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al. published
years ago, 20 years ago, data hold really nicely time.
published Journal American Medical Association Psychiatry. JAMA Psychiatry
superb journal. basically people bipolar 1 average spend 50%,
actually 53% number eventually converged upon, 50%
time symptom-free. interesting, right? Somebody genuine bipolar 1
disorder can spend much half life symptom-free, sleeping normally,
speaking normally, et cetera. 32% time depressed, say
depressed, mean major depression. severe challenges waking two
three morning, trouble falling back asleep. one defining
characteristics depression, sleeping far much, hard time getting
bed morning, suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
general symptoms major depression talk little bit later
upcoming episode major depression particular. 15%
time kind manic state mixed manic state, showing
long, again, seven days bouts sleeplessness, irritability, pressured speech,
grandiosity, et cetera. Contrast people bipolar 2 disorder
spending half time depressed state. interesting, people


bipolar 2 disorder, not always displaying depressed states oscillations
mania hypomania depressed states, tend depressed state
often. again, major depression. isn't just little bit low,
serious depression nervous system, mood, say, affect,
outlook life, one key distinguishing features major depression
people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see
future. ask about, work going? How're relationships? not
just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity
things improve. people bipolar 2 tend symptom-free
45% time. Again, averages, 45% time,
considerable amount time. tend hypomanic states
4 5% time. Again, criteria BP-II, bipolar 2 four days less
mania hypomania, 4% time 5% time small enough
sliver pie people's existence imagine
easy people overlook fact bipolar disorder not
major depression. Think it. person who, say collection
people spending half time depressed, close half, 45%
time symptom-free, 5% time hypomanic state. either
shorten bouts high intensity mania hypomania reduced intensity. One
reasons mentioned percentages time spent symptom-free,
depressed manic hypomanic state one major goals today's
episode will increase awareness whether not somebody know,
coworker, family member, et cetera, might suffering bipolar
1 bipolar 2. think fair say somebody suffering bipolar 1,
likely revealed reveal long, fact people
extended periods mania mania extreme state, not just
person experiencing it, way presents just extreme
ordinary. bipolar 2, can imagine really duck radar
awareness. imagine might just think somebody low
depressed, especially person tends self-medicate alcohol
substances. might think, oh, drinking often usual,
excuse me, spending time alone isolating.
hypomanic state, might actually present normal us
depressed state before. important dial awareness,


tune antennae possibility people might appear

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying

disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring

miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal

report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug

individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting

lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners

nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

people's outlook life becomes diminished sense don't see

just feel going poorly, really feel no opportunity

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder



bipolar disorder, perhaps family members person.
goal within episode now provide clear detailed picture
bipolar disorder various forms. start talk treatments bipolar
disorder neural circuit basis bipolar disorder, want make sure
distinguish bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder. will
entire episode maybe even several episodes borderline personality disorder.
Borderline personality disorder can indeed present ways resemble bipolar
disorder vice versa, key distinctions need made
turns bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder quite distinct
terms defining criteria. key distinction somebody borderline
personality disorder bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder,
can episodes can resemble mania hypomania. periods flights ideas,
people spending money excessively sexually promiscuous ways
seem manic even little bit manic lot manic, yet often
not, environmental trigger manic episodes. distinctly different
bipolar disorder person will manic episodes without need

00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts

person borderline personality disorder one mode next. move
discussion treatments neural circuits underlying bipolar
disorder, want just nail one key point. brief point
perhaps important point, highs lows, say
highs, manic episodes, sometimes lows, 'cause again, not everybody
bipolar disorder 1 2 suffers depressive episodes, sometimes yes, sometimes no,


particular bipolar 2, yes, people bipolar 1 can extreme manic
episodes just return normal recall. Well, extreme lows
extreme highs people bipolar disorder impact lives negative ways.
essential something going return little bit later
talk relationship bipolar disorder creativity, turns
quite strong association there, one almost lead believe
bipolar can beneficial certain contexts, yet, whole, bipolar
disorder extremely detrimental challenging person suffering it.
something want keep mind

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring
lithium. Lithium, know, periodic table elements. indeed
naturally occurring substance. actually arrived earth way star dust. Yes,
talking star dust podcast, like learn
origins lithium lithium arrived earth discovery applications

can refer to, less biology talk, certainly lot lithium
element. nerds like me, love know things came
planet one form another, encourage take brief listen
talk. going discuss lithium context applications treatment


bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,
measure amount lithium, three times day. four days, distinctly

February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,
including descriptions patients suffered negative side effects.
important point well, absolutely wonderful paper
absolutely wonderful voyage history psychiatry right discussion
just three short paragraphs, Cade really lays case lithium
important discovery treatment what, time,

01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects

number important side effects need considered. First all,
certain toxicity levels lithium blood need monitored extremely
carefully. not sort thing people can just take given dose every

01:05:05 Effects Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection

prior understanding biological basis disease treatment
needed. Now said, scientists clinicians quite rigorous trying
understand lithium works order understand
bipolar disorder. way proper medicine science done. Even
excellent treatment something, important understand
treatment works because, first all, not everyone responds treatment. Second
all, scientists physicians understand just one treatment
works, side effects all, possibility better treatments.
not just trying bypass drug doesn't make much money drug
companies, know lot people think terms, think, oh, well,
continued search better treatments bipolar disorder even though lithium works
lithium doesn't allow drug companies make much money. not really
case. fact matter toxicity, issues
created lithium, fact people need ongoing blood testing, et cetera, really
stimulates need, really urgent need new better treatments bipolar
disorder. understanding lithium works cellular level, neural
circuit level, et cetera, really stand find new discoveries.
literature search actions mechanisms lithium terms can calm
people reduce manic episodes, find enormous array
papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important
context neural circuits involved bipolar disorder minutes. also
seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially
relates health condition, like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always
seems discussed context inflammation bad. want point
inflammation natural adaptive response physical injury cell organ
tissue kind. Inflammation basis adaptations occur exercise.
if, instance, weight train use heavier normal weight kind,
set failure create little micro tears muscle healthy
sense create adaptations make muscle stronger, maybe even
grow muscle, inflammatory response associated critical
positive adaptation. inflammation isn't always bad, although excessive,
say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain
particular. important. return important little bit.
thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.
can get hit really hard head, bullet, God forbid, can enter skull kill
neurons, lot reasons neurons can die. Neuroprotection situation
neuron given sort chemical physical resiliency allows
suffer insult yet bounce back. similar way think
psychological resiliency, neuroprotection ability neurons better able
handle stress different kinds, particular, excitotoxicity. phenomenon


bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO

really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric

lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,

likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,

64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed

essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link

00:38:20 Consequences Bipolar Disorder, Heritability

haven't heard might actually suffering bipolar 2
disorder. move in-depth discussion different kinds
treatments bipolar disorder, like touch just additional aspects
bipolar disorder can terms negative consequences. also talk
inherited risk genetic factors environmental factors can
contribute bipolar disorder. terms burden, real, emotional,
occupational educational burden can occur somebody bipolar disorder,
actually studied. measure this, called global burden
defined years lost engaging normal life due disability.
disability cancer disability, case, bipolar disorder. basically
way sort study done questionnaires, say quite in-
depth questionnaires, probing whether not somebody lost two
consecutive weeks interest normal activities. Now, people
depression, kind straightforward thing address, right? ask somebody,
last time ate, last time went days
without food lost interest relationships work sex things sort
answer can figure amount time essentially withdrawn
normal levels activity them. bipolar disorder, turns
global burden bipolar 1 even bipolar 2 massive. fact, bipolar
disorder sits one highest risk factors top 10 categories
disabilities leading global burden. Put plain English, means
bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder extremely debilitating. really slows one's life
trajectory unless treated properly. Now, aspect bipolar disorder
heritability. gets little bit tricky science related inheritability
versus genetic contribution given disease. might sound like
thing, think, okay, genes relate heritability, heritability relates genes,
course, everything way nervous system works functions
expresses itself, healthy otherwise, interaction genes
environment. typically way studies done address


risk somebody given condition general population? talked
before, bipolar disorder 1% world's population. Compare people
major depression. repeated bouts two weeks
serious depression, not just low mood something due life loss, major
depression, 10 17% people major depression. suffer major
depressive disorder, compared bipolar disorder which, again, 1%. Now, can
address much 1% bipolar disorder exists due genes versus
environment somewhat exact way. never exact science. way
typically done look concordance, likelihood two identical
twins will given condition opposed two fraternal twins,
different genes identical twins, course. two siblings
similar genes, course, less similar identical fraternal twins
forth. basically evaluate probability two people
general population completely unrelated will condition, versus
two people general population related, identical twins.
find identical twins, one identical twin true major depression major
depressive disorder, 20 45% chance identical twin will also
major depressive disorder. Now tells right can't genes,
not gene major depression per se, gene collection genes,
genes also subject environmental influences, either prenatal, within
womb children born. Now large range 20 45% due
number things. experimental, meaning techniques used
experiments, due regional differences, one part world versus
another. lot different factors. Right now, probably shouldn't delve
that. point, probably episode genetics nervous
system heritability heritability features mental health, et cetera. can
compare major depression heritability genetic concordance
identical twins major depression bipolar disorder ask, one twin
identical twin pair bipolar depression, likelihood twin will
it? turns number much higher. 40 70% likelihood
probability one twin bipolar disorder, identical twin will also
bipolar disorder. again, total incidence bipolar disorder general
population much lower major depressions, 1% bipolar versus 10
17% major depression. genetic component much higher, 40 70%


bipolar disorder versus 20 45% major depression. know throwing lot
numbers there, basically means researchers able
take numbers filter number different risk factors
related early development, ask questions like two twins raised separately
together, one part world versus another, two parent household
versus one parent household, evaluate lot different variables, able
discover, shown again, genetic contribution
bipolar disorder very, high. heritability bipolar disorder 85%.
again, want really clear means, total occurrence general
population, fairly low, still serious, 1%, fairly low compared things like major
depression. However, someone bipolar disorder, likely inherited
gene sets genes, accurately, susceptibility within genes
environmental influences can trigger bipolar disorder. lot different
ways discuss conceptualize heritability want careful way
wording this. means people bipolar disorder likely
gene, typically going set genes creates susceptibility
bipolar disorder present itself. Now, environmental factors trigger increase
susceptibility not entirely clear. always seems center back onto
sets things like early life stress, trauma, et cetera, certainly going
exacerbate likelihood someone genetic propensity bipolar disorder
will express bipolar disorder full array symptomology, 85%, very,
high, not 100%. Again, 85%, high number heritability not 100%.
means no single gene identified gene cluster bipolar
disorder. reason keep drilling think can
confidently say someone bipolar disorder, something
genetic lineage led that, likely led that, yet not like eye color
physical feature, can actually direct, called
Mendelian genetics, figure whether not somebody directly inherited gene
one parent parent. takeaway certainly
identical twin, fraternal twin, sibling parent, even cousin uncle
bipolar disorder, particular bipolar 1, well, need lookout

00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder



bipolar disorder, perhaps family members person.
goal within episode now provide clear detailed picture
bipolar disorder various forms. start talk treatments bipolar

entire episode maybe even several episodes borderline personality disorder.
Borderline personality disorder can indeed present ways resemble bipolar

bipolar disorder 1 2 suffers depressive episodes, sometimes yes, sometimes no,


particular bipolar 2, yes, people bipolar 1 can extreme manic

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring
lithium. Lithium, know, periodic table elements. indeed
naturally occurring substance. actually arrived earth way star dust. Yes,
talking star dust podcast, like learn
origins lithium lithium arrived earth discovery applications
psychiatry, beautiful talk exists YouTube provide link

planet one form another, encourage take brief listen
talk. going discuss lithium context applications treatment


bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,
measure amount lithium, three times day. four days, distinctly
quieter February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal. continued well
February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,
including descriptions patients suffered negative side effects.
important point well, absolutely wonderful paper
absolutely wonderful voyage history psychiatry right discussion
just three short paragraphs, Cade really lays case lithium
important discovery treatment what, time,

01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects

understand lithium works order understand
bipolar disorder. way proper medicine science done. Even
excellent treatment something, important understand
treatment works because, first all, not everyone responds treatment. Second
all, scientists physicians understand just one treatment
works, side effects all, possibility better treatments.
not just trying bypass drug doesn't make much money drug

papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important

discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting

lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even

hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric

problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright

yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things

will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really

inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like

jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem

changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive

financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing

depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create

family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,

incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes
bipolar. However, least knowledge, again, knowledge, not
controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis
treatment bipolar disorder, per se, data supporting use psilocybin
treatment bipolar disorder per se. realize, say that, going
number people may positive negative experiences
cannabis psilocybin relate bipolar disorder. please, willing
comfortable, put that, comfortable, comment section YouTube.


course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive
outcomes treatment bipolar disorder, please provide links PubMed ideas
those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying

disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring

bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.

can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic

bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic

little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

00:53:06 History Lithium Treatment

think treatments underlying biology. Now like talk
treatments bipolar disorder. discussion treatments,
absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons
talk about. description discovery treatment bipolar
disorder, also reveals us sometimes treatments come profession
medicine science ways precede discovery underlying
biology. right, every while, someone will discover treatment
disease without understanding underlying biological basis disease.
fact, case bipolar disorder treatment referring

bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,

February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,

01:05:05 Effects Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection

prior understanding biological basis disease treatment
needed. Now said, scientists clinicians quite rigorous trying
understand lithium works order understand
bipolar disorder. way proper medicine science done. Even
excellent treatment something, important understand
treatment works because, first all, not everyone responds treatment. Second
all, scientists physicians understand just one treatment
works, side effects all, possibility better treatments.
not just trying bypass drug doesn't make much money drug
companies, know lot people think terms, think, oh, well,
continued search better treatments bipolar disorder even though lithium works
lithium doesn't allow drug companies make much money. not really
case. fact matter toxicity, issues
created lithium, fact people need ongoing blood testing, et cetera, really
stimulates need, really urgent need new better treatments bipolar
disorder. understanding lithium works cellular level, neural
circuit level, et cetera, really stand find new discoveries.
literature search actions mechanisms lithium terms can calm
people reduce manic episodes, find enormous array
papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important

seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially

say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain
particular. important. return important little bit.
thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.
can get hit really hard head, bullet, God forbid, can enter skull kill

psychological resiliency, neuroprotection ability neurons better able
handle stress different kinds, particular, excitotoxicity. phenomenon


bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.

talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings

lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period

exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,

individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting

lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every

omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link

likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,

64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people

essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms

miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case

papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived

brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going

BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

watching listening. reality people bipolar

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes

longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments

different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes

important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

hence used try calm people allow sleep

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like

membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

absolutely incredible history discovery one particular treatment still
shows great success many patients, although people can't take reasons

miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal

chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case

turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals

neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes

20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown

this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period

really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human

inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

bipolar disorder. discovery lithium treatment bipolar disorder truly
miraculous story think everyone know. key player story
physician last name Cade, Australian physician. Cade
interesting story right. Cade Australian psychiatrist Australian
psychiatrist also soldier. World War II, fall Singapore
Japan, became prisoner war prisoner war 1942
1945. time observation imprisonment, observed
fellow inmates going pretty wild vacillations mood energy,
essentially going manic episodes depressed episodes, manic normal
episodes. one reason another, don't know couldn't find
report hypothesized this, hypothesized buildup
chemical people's brains urinate out.
urinating whatever chemical allow relaxed
not manic. words, Cade hypothesized buildup chemical
certain people's brains makes manic urinate chemical out.
eventually got prison, mentioned 1945, started
experiments addition seeing patients clinic. started
take urine people exhibited mania urine people not manic,
took urine inject guinea pigs experimental model.
general observation something urine indeed
making guinea pigs manic injected urine manic patient.
exact measures taking guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
time era science just sort report things little bit
subjectively, although still numbers statistics, little bit
like case studies descriptions, turns even though seems little
bit loose, led incredible still important discoveries psychiatric health.
figured urine manic patients seemed toxic
guinea pigs. also knew two toxic substances urine,
urea uric acid. able separate urea uric acid people
mania patients not mania. figured urea
mentally ill, manic patients non manic patients. not
seem urea compound creating manic episodes related
manic episodes held toxicity instead focused uric acid. Now order
put uric acid solution inject guinea pigs,


try number different compounds order dilute it. just happens that,
chemists will familiar this, certain things just don't go solution
easily. put powder vial, add water saline another solution,
mix powder stays suspended there, doesn't actually ever become
clear liquid can inject. order try injecting different strengths uric acid,
ended using lithium assist dilution, lithium worked.
basically doing, chemists, taking uric acid, adding
lithium, making solution lithium urate. lot details, important
eventually found diluted uric acid lithium
created lithium urate, lithium urate actually calm guinea pigs
injected toxic urea. also found lithium urate generally calming
effect guinea pigs. now really off crazy territory, talking
urine patients separating urea uric acid, adding lithium
uric acid, injecting guinea pigs, getting pretty wild pretty weird,
medicine, time time, medicine science. Cade
good scientist addition good physician, good scientists, mean
control experiments. injecting lithium urate animals seeing
effect, knew solution lithium urate contained not just uric acid,
also contained lithium. quite appropriately asked, maybe lithium
alone calming effect guinea pigs. indeed, case.
proper control experiment injected lithium solution
guinea pigs, calmed down. there, sort 1940 style medicine,
not happen now, quickly moved animal model human patients
started injecting human patients lithium providing lithium orally patients.
lo behold, found absolutely profound positive effect lithium
reducing symptoms mania. good physician scientists do, wrote
results. wrote paper entitled, Lithium Salts Treatment
Psychotic Excitement. Okay, back didn't call mania, called psychotic
excitement. paper published September 3rd, 1949 Medical
Journal Australia. will provide link study, now classic study field
psychiatry. really wonderful paper read. actually encourage people,
even not scientist clinician just take quick look second page
paper made available describes various case
studies individuals looked at. not going read detail now,


'cause take lot unnecessary time, things like case seven, MC, aged 40-
years-old, suffering manic recurrent mania. episode, excited,
restless, violent two months interfering often
confined single room day. debilitating, now know
bipolar depression. commenced taking lithium citrate, 20 grains,
measure amount lithium, three times day. four days, distinctly
quieter February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal. continued well
February 20th, 1949, dose citrate reduced 10 grains, et cetera, et
cetera. left hospital. numerous descriptions sort within
paper, including descriptions patients not see success,
including descriptions patients suffered negative side effects.
important point well, absolutely wonderful paper
absolutely wonderful voyage history psychiatry right discussion
just three short paragraphs, Cade really lays case lithium
important discovery treatment what, time,

understand lithium works order understand
bipolar disorder. way proper medicine science done. Even
excellent treatment something, important understand
treatment works because, first all, not everyone responds treatment. Second
all, scientists physicians understand just one treatment
works, side effects all, possibility better treatments.
not just trying bypass drug doesn't make much money drug
companies, know lot people think terms, think, oh, well,
continued search better treatments bipolar disorder even though lithium works
lithium doesn't allow drug companies make much money. not really

created lithium, fact people need ongoing blood testing, et cetera, really
stimulates need, really urgent need new better treatments bipolar
disorder. understanding lithium works cellular level, neural
circuit level, et cetera, really stand find new discoveries.
literature search actions mechanisms lithium terms can calm
people reduce manic episodes, find enormous array
papers, literally thousands scientific studies animals humans, which,


instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important
context neural circuits involved bipolar disorder minutes. also
seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially
relates health condition, like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always
seems discussed context inflammation bad. want point

say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain

thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.

psychological resiliency, neuroprotection ability neurons better able
handle stress different kinds, particular, excitotoxicity. phenomenon


bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start

depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately
solutions solution often not, accurate
understanding whether not someone bipolar depression not, stage

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater

used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO

nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going

this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements

bipolar disorder, things often talked suggested,
especially online communities, not clear particularly
hazardous own, although carry hazards, think
important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural
circuit changes people can avoid less effective demonstrated
ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar
disorder family members, provided not manic
episode due close heritability bipolar disorder, family members can often
excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,
many people problem. often associated

happening right now. ECT, repetitive TMS rTMS,
mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies, targeted toward depressive

incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes

controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals

neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people

bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits

circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity

everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes

20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like

nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown

this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period

really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human

inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals

can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible

atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits

lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature

especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining

think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes

exchange words depending person walked office,

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO

nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited

shown again, neurons exposed lithium period

now common FDA-approved, least US, approved

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

hence used try calm people allow sleep

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start

person may genuinely not know. ask depressed person,
depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken

instance will tell lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor. BDNF often talked context neuroplasticity,
brain nervous system's ability change response experience. indeed
seem ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF call permissive
neuroplasticity. doesn't create specific changes brain, meaning not going
make memory better coordination better, emotional state better per
se, BDNF permits neurons, nerve cells connections
brain likely change proper environmental conditions met.
BDNF creates kind buoyancy neuroplasticity. opens gates
neuroplasticity. lithium increase BDNF, talk important
context neural circuits involved bipolar disorder minutes. also
seems potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation one words
thrown around extensively nowadays, especially social media especially
relates health condition, like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always
seems discussed context inflammation bad. want point
inflammation natural adaptive response physical injury cell organ
tissue kind. Inflammation basis adaptations occur exercise.
if, instance, weight train use heavier normal weight kind,
set failure create little micro tears muscle healthy
sense create adaptations make muscle stronger, maybe even
grow muscle, inflammatory response associated critical
positive adaptation. inflammation isn't always bad, although excessive,
say, runaway inflammation bad. Lithium seems able suppress inflammation
and, importantly, can suppress inflammation neural tissues within brain
particular. important. return important little bit.
thing lithium lithium neuroprotective, can prevent
neurons dying certain conditions. neurons die? Well,
lot reasons neurons can die. can physical insult neurons.
can get hit really hard head, bullet, God forbid, can enter skull kill
neurons, lot reasons neurons can die. Neuroprotection situation
neuron given sort chemical physical resiliency allows
suffer insult yet bounce back. similar way think
psychological resiliency, neuroprotection ability neurons better able
handle stress different kinds, particular, excitotoxicity. phenomenon


bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start
wane disappear people bipolar disorder circuits interoception,
understanding going one's body. can imagine sit
ask somebody, well, long have, since slept,
person may genuinely not know. ask depressed person,
depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately
solutions solution often not, accurate
understanding whether not someone bipolar depression not, stage
illness might not going depend reports people around
not patient themselves, hence importance rather detailed
admittedly rather intense discussion symptomology bipolar disorder,
can understanding people around eye

01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System

whether not people might suffering bipolar, so, stage
disease might happen at. Now like talk little bit

paper. fairly recent paper, just came year, excellent
one, Looking changes time neural circuitry people high genetic risk

exceedingly important fact track individuals time.
title paper is, Longitudinal Changes Structural Connectivity Young
People High Genetic Risk Bipolar Disorder. will provide link study
show note captions. lot data paper, particular, neuroimaging
data, quite extensive terms analyzing so-called connectomics.
probably heard genomics, analysis genes display different
individuals different animals, et cetera. proteomics, display of,
existence different proteins. omics big thing now science, kind
throw omics behind anything becomes Wikipedia page, means

connectomics analysis connections different neurons neural circuit

circuits brains many different people different categories of, onset of,

people particularly high risk bipolar disorder full
blown bipolar disorder, deficits actually reductions amount

Now, limbic system talked podcast, not familiar

really seems going people bipolar disorder. Now,
disruptions circuitry present limbic system, doesn't necessarily
mean limbic system fault way neural circuits work
different brain areas talking one another electrical-chemical signaling,
regulating one another. paper really tells us

01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine

bipolar disorder, talk going forward can benefit patients bipolar.
appears lithium exerting positive effects bipolar depression treatment,
least part preventing loss certain neural circuits, namely neural circuits
interoception top control limbic system. Now turns


examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons
influencing electrical excitability postsynaptic neurons sits central not just
treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available
synapse influence postsynaptic cell. Homeostatic plasticity form
neuroplasticity overall circuits can become much excitable much less
excitable addition receptors postsynaptic neuron removal
receptors postsynaptic neuron. way happens just
beautiful. first discovered visual system person primarily
responsible discovery homeostatic plasticity, although several,
woman name Gina Turrigiano, professor Brandeis University.
Turrigiano Laboratory showed instance, dark
long period time, literally, not seeing much long period time,
increase number receptors postsynaptic neurons smaller
amount light excitability within visual system can lead greater amounts
activity visual system. Conversely, overactivity increase
activity visual system period time, number receptors
postsynaptic neuron removed postsynaptic neuron surface, making
neurotransmitter available able bind receptors left
less influence cells. words, keeping circuit so-called
homeostatic balance particular range excitability. Now, mouthful
earful concept-full, don't know concept-full word, case,
lot think about, need know neural circuit active
period time, normal individuals, will reduction amount
activity way removing receptors bind neurotransmitter. Whereas, neural
circuit quiet, not activated period time, maybe leg cast
instance, not activating quadricep calves much, well
cast comes off, sure, muscle might atrophied nerves connect
muscle actually position influence muscle even start using


muscle muscles, whatever neurotransmitter released now
opportunity bind receptors, case muscle, case brain
circuits, postsynaptic neurons. homeostatic plasticity beautiful, balancing
mechanism makes sure neural circuits never active quiet
long. beautiful display treatments can lead better understanding
biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher
lower depending homeostatic plasticity. paper shows
shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved
treatment major depression, ketamine opposite. Ketamine seems increase
number receptors postsynaptic neuron lead greater levels
excitability electrical activity within neural circuits given fixed amount
neurotransmitter. super interesting means lithium
causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective
treatment major depression, major depressive episodes people
suffer bipolar depression, includes major depressive episodes two
weeks longer suppressed mood, appetite, sleep issues, et cetera. Now, key
thing ketamine often not discussed effects potent,


transient. one major drawback ketamine therapy depression
done repeatedly, repeatedly, often, rather, depends,
course, discussion psychiatrist patient. not something
cowboy own. know that, many probably familiar fact
ketamine also abused recreationally. so-called NMDA, N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor antagonist, blocks receptor responsible
neuroplasticity changes neural circuits. also changes excitability neurons
just described. ketamine potent chemical shown
now FDA approved treatment major depression,
effects seem transient. Lithium, described earlier, seems reduce manic

love great number psychiatric illnesses. fortunately
bipolar disorder. Overactivity given circuit eventually leads neurotoxicity,
excuse me, lithium preventing neurotoxicity reducing number receptors
certain elements within circuits, called homeostatic scaling,

think, excitotoxicity. sense, can see exactly important get
lithium treatment early people bipolar disorder. Ketamine treatment
major depression seems effective transient. can also see
important, not just reduce manic episodes people bipolar
disorder, also treat depressive episodes. key feature
treatment bipolar depression bipolar disorder. needs treatment
mania depressive episodes present. fortunately,
excellent drugs that. mention ketamine lithium
just two drugs within kit psychiatrists access to. many
things, olanzapines number different, including Clozapine. Clozapine
antipsychotic commonly prescribed sedative cases allows
people manic episodes sleep. classically described called dopamine

based early, early discussion constitutes bipolar 1 bipolar 2. Now
like also talk not typical therapeutics bipolar disorder
also point things tried failed successful treatment

especially online communities, not clear particularly
hazardous own, although carry hazards, think
important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural

ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar

excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot

family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set

recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive

financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing

depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human

inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger

bipolar disorder lot psychiatric conditions hyperactivity certain
brain areas actually starts kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always this,
turns certain brain circuits active long, chemicals
associated neuroactivity, things like calcium neurotransmitters like glutamate
can actually kill neurons active. seems lithium can prevent
neurotoxicity. Now, turns particularly important
discussion bipolar disorder

01:10:10 Neural Circuits Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity

neural circuit basis bipolar disorder just take step back
ask, different brains people bipolar disorder?
interesting answers start emerge. basically two main neural
circuits present normal individuals, say normal, say respectfully
people bipolar disorder referring people not suffer manic
episodes manic depression. circuits present people
bipolar disorder people not suffer bipolar disorder,
circuits thing sets individuals, yet people bipolar
disorder, seems atrophy removal certain neural connections
time leads situation people bipolar disorder become poor
registering internal state, particular, emotional states somatic
states. referring something called interoception. talked
little bit Huberman Lab Podcast before, two modes
perception. Perception, course, attention something happening
environment us within body. Exteroception literally attention
things happening beyond confines skin. seeing person's face
there, seeing color leaf there, hearing sound left,
exteroception, perception things beyond confines one's skin.
interoception perception things happening internally like, full
gut feel? fast heart beating? people can measure quite
accurately just thinking it, people can't. happy I, sad I,
energetic I, lethargic I, et cetera, et cetera. always existing
balance exteroception interoception, turns out, people
bipolar disorder time, especially second third decade


bipolar disorder seem progressively diminished levels interoception.
likely important inability register, instance, that, wow,
talking excessive rate haven't slept 5 even 10 days, haven't
eaten long period time. atrophy neural circuits interoception starting
emerge one defining neural circuit characteristics underpinnings
bipolar. Now bridge conversation neural circuits statement
lithium can protect neurotoxic effects neural circuits
active. Now can get little bit complicated, promise going make clear
watching listening. reality people bipolar
depression likely hyperactivity, increased level activity certain
circuits within brain early expression disease. typically,
mentioned earlier, sets around early 20s, although sometimes can even
earlier, teens forth. hyperactivity, think, leads toxicity
excitotoxicity certain elements neural circuits responsible
interoception. words, overuse certain circuits can lead diminishing,
atrophy, even death certain elements within circuits appears
lithium, anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects ability
increase BDNF, likely protects us atrophy circuits
interoception. isn't case people bipolar neural circuit
lack neural circuit people without bipolar opposite. case
everyone less starts same, seems hyperactivity
certain neural circuits people bipolar disorder time actually causes
circuits diminish. Now, important recent
longitudinal studies brain imaging people bipolar disorder
without, time patients starting early teens,
20s 30s reveals just that, can hyperactivity circuits early on,
hypo, reduced activity circuits time 5 10 years later. Again,
speaks complicated nature bipolar disorder complicated nature
psychiatry linking specific psychiatric disorders neural circuits general.
situation one disease, just, hypothesize second
instance, certain forms schizophrenia, elevated dopamine
just reduce amount dopamine, receive relief
schizophrenic symptoms, well, pretty straightforward face it,
situation bipolar disorder, talking hyperactivity, much activity


leading hypoactivity death circuits. now can
especially appreciate patient shows psychiatrist
psychiatrist shows patient total course disease going
important. layer top complexity fact defining
characteristic bipolar disorder oscillations mood. now need
think treatments, not just manic episodes, also treatments
depressive episodes. that's, fact, psychiatrists do. Turns apply
different treatments combinations treatments patients manic episodes
versus depressive episodes infer discussions, again, just
exchange words depending person walked office,
terms manic episodes, no symptomology depressive symptomology,
whether not symptomology extended period time.
just make situation even complicated, circuits atrophy start
wane disappear people bipolar disorder circuits interoception,
understanding going one's body. can imagine sit
ask somebody, well, long have, since slept,
person may genuinely not know. ask depressed person,
depressed you? person may not able articulate that. fortunately
solutions solution often not, accurate
understanding whether not someone bipolar depression not, stage
illness might not going depend reports people around
not patient themselves, hence importance rather detailed
admittedly rather intense discussion symptomology bipolar disorder,
can understanding people around eye

exceedingly important fact track individuals time.
title paper is, Longitudinal Changes Structural Connectivity Young
People High Genetic Risk Bipolar Disorder. will provide link study

data, quite extensive terms analyzing so-called connectomics.
probably heard genomics, analysis genes display different

Now, limbic system talked podcast, not familiar

disruptions circuitry present limbic system, doesn't necessarily
mean limbic system fault way neural circuits work
different brain areas talking one another electrical-chemical signaling,

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons
influencing electrical excitability postsynaptic neurons sits central not just
treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available
synapse influence postsynaptic cell. Homeostatic plasticity form
neuroplasticity overall circuits can become much excitable much less
excitable addition receptors postsynaptic neuron removal
receptors postsynaptic neuron. way happens just
beautiful. first discovered visual system person primarily
responsible discovery homeostatic plasticity, although several,
woman name Gina Turrigiano, professor Brandeis University.
Turrigiano Laboratory showed instance, dark
long period time, literally, not seeing much long period time,
increase number receptors postsynaptic neurons smaller
amount light excitability within visual system can lead greater amounts
activity visual system. Conversely, overactivity increase
activity visual system period time, number receptors
postsynaptic neuron removed postsynaptic neuron surface, making
neurotransmitter available able bind receptors left
less influence cells. words, keeping circuit so-called
homeostatic balance particular range excitability. Now, mouthful
earful concept-full, don't know concept-full word, case,
lot think about, need know neural circuit active
period time, normal individuals, will reduction amount
activity way removing receptors bind neurotransmitter. Whereas, neural
circuit quiet, not activated period time, maybe leg cast
instance, not activating quadricep calves much, well
cast comes off, sure, muscle might atrophied nerves connect
muscle actually position influence muscle even start using


muscle muscles, whatever neurotransmitter released now
opportunity bind receptors, case muscle, case brain
circuits, postsynaptic neurons. homeostatic plasticity beautiful, balancing
mechanism makes sure neural circuits never active quiet
long. beautiful display treatments can lead better understanding
biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher
lower depending homeostatic plasticity. paper shows
shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved
treatment major depression, ketamine opposite. Ketamine seems increase
number receptors postsynaptic neuron lead greater levels
excitability electrical activity within neural circuits given fixed amount
neurotransmitter. super interesting means lithium
causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective
treatment major depression, major depressive episodes people
suffer bipolar depression, includes major depressive episodes two
weeks longer suppressed mood, appetite, sleep issues, et cetera. Now, key
thing ketamine often not discussed effects potent,


transient. one major drawback ketamine therapy depression

excuse me, lithium preventing neurotoxicity reducing number receptors

not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human

inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed

essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can

mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime

talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies

next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked

OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar

excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go

convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,

psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

hence used try calm people allow sleep

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells

whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less

beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.

risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken

paper. fairly recent paper, just came year, excellent
one, Looking changes time neural circuitry people high genetic risk
bipolar disorder, particular young people. studies sort rare,
exceedingly important fact track individuals time.
title paper is, Longitudinal Changes Structural Connectivity Young
People High Genetic Risk Bipolar Disorder. will provide link study
show note captions. lot data paper, particular, neuroimaging
data, quite extensive terms analyzing so-called connectomics.
probably heard genomics, analysis genes display different
individuals different animals, et cetera. proteomics, display of,

disruptions circuitry present limbic system, doesn't necessarily
mean limbic system fault way neural circuits work

bipolar disorder, talk going forward can benefit patients bipolar.
appears lithium exerting positive effects bipolar depression treatment,
least part preventing loss certain neural circuits, namely neural circuits
interoception top control limbic system. Now turns


examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons
influencing electrical excitability postsynaptic neurons sits central not just
treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available
synapse influence postsynaptic cell. Homeostatic plasticity form
neuroplasticity overall circuits can become much excitable much less
excitable addition receptors postsynaptic neuron removal
receptors postsynaptic neuron. way happens just
beautiful. first discovered visual system person primarily
responsible discovery homeostatic plasticity, although several,
woman name Gina Turrigiano, professor Brandeis University.
Turrigiano Laboratory showed instance, dark
long period time, literally, not seeing much long period time,
increase number receptors postsynaptic neurons smaller
amount light excitability within visual system can lead greater amounts
activity visual system. Conversely, overactivity increase
activity visual system period time, number receptors
postsynaptic neuron removed postsynaptic neuron surface, making
neurotransmitter available able bind receptors left
less influence cells. words, keeping circuit so-called
homeostatic balance particular range excitability. Now, mouthful
earful concept-full, don't know concept-full word, case,
lot think about, need know neural circuit active
period time, normal individuals, will reduction amount
activity way removing receptors bind neurotransmitter. Whereas, neural
circuit quiet, not activated period time, maybe leg cast
instance, not activating quadricep calves much, well
cast comes off, sure, muscle might atrophied nerves connect
muscle actually position influence muscle even start using


muscle muscles, whatever neurotransmitter released now
opportunity bind receptors, case muscle, case brain
circuits, postsynaptic neurons. homeostatic plasticity beautiful, balancing
mechanism makes sure neural circuits never active quiet
long. beautiful display treatments can lead better understanding
biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher
lower depending homeostatic plasticity. paper shows
shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved
treatment major depression, ketamine opposite. Ketamine seems increase
number receptors postsynaptic neuron lead greater levels
excitability electrical activity within neural circuits given fixed amount
neurotransmitter. super interesting means lithium
causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective
treatment major depression, major depressive episodes people
suffer bipolar depression, includes major depressive episodes two
weeks longer suppressed mood, appetite, sleep issues, et cetera. Now, key
thing ketamine often not discussed effects potent,


transient. one major drawback ketamine therapy depression
done repeatedly, repeatedly, often, rather, depends,
course, discussion psychiatrist patient. not something
cowboy own. know that, many probably familiar fact
ketamine also abused recreationally. so-called NMDA, N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor antagonist, blocks receptor responsible
neuroplasticity changes neural circuits. also changes excitability neurons
just described. ketamine potent chemical shown
now FDA approved treatment major depression,
effects seem transient. Lithium, described earlier, seems reduce manic

love great number psychiatric illnesses. fortunately
bipolar disorder. Overactivity given circuit eventually leads neurotoxicity,
excuse me, lithium preventing neurotoxicity reducing number receptors
certain elements within circuits, called homeostatic scaling,
downregulating number receptors leading less excitability preventing,
think, excitotoxicity. sense, can see exactly important get
lithium treatment early people bipolar disorder. Ketamine treatment
major depression seems effective transient. can also see
important, not just reduce manic episodes people bipolar
disorder, also treat depressive episodes. key feature
treatment bipolar depression bipolar disorder. needs treatment
mania depressive episodes present. fortunately,
excellent drugs that. mention ketamine lithium
just two drugs within kit psychiatrists access to. many
things, olanzapines number different, including Clozapine. Clozapine
antipsychotic commonly prescribed sedative cases allows
people manic episodes sleep. classically described called dopamine

Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy

based early, early discussion constitutes bipolar 1 bipolar 2. Now
like also talk not typical therapeutics bipolar disorder
also point things tried failed successful treatment
bipolar disorder, things often talked suggested,
especially online communities, not clear particularly
hazardous own, although carry hazards, think
important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural
circuit changes people can avoid less effective demonstrated
ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar
disorder family members, provided not manic
episode due close heritability bipolar disorder, family members can often
excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,
many people problem. often associated
memory loss. memory loss, invasive nature ECT cost


oftentimes rule ECT patients, sort late stage kind
last resort type thing treatment-resistant depression. Nowadays ketamine type
therapy done repeatedly treatments, instance, transcranial magnetic

treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright

yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons
influencing electrical excitability postsynaptic neurons sits central not just
treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available

biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher
lower depending homeostatic plasticity. paper shows
shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved
treatment major depression, ketamine opposite. Ketamine seems increase
number receptors postsynaptic neuron lead greater levels
excitability electrical activity within neural circuits given fixed amount
neurotransmitter. super interesting means lithium
causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective
treatment major depression, major depressive episodes people
suffer bipolar depression, includes major depressive episodes two
weeks longer suppressed mood, appetite, sleep issues, et cetera. Now, key
thing ketamine often not discussed effects potent,

talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies

next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked

OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug

combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar

excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot

family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic

recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way

not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting

Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,

family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

examining lithium's effects even reductionist level, can gain really
important insight going bipolar depression
treatments bipolar depression, including behavioral treatments, things like
transcranial magnetic stimulation, even natural so-called
nutraceutical treatments including things like high dose omega-3 supplementation,
going talk extensively. Now, order understand going
talk next, important everybody understand key concept
neuroplasticity. key concept regardless whether not one talking
bipolar depression. fact, something think everybody, every citizen earth
know about, called homeostatic plasticity. Homeostatic plasticity
particular form neuroplasticity neural circuit overactive period
time, changes occur cellular level lead balance
homeostatic regulation circuit no longer overactive. Conversely,
neural circuit underactive period time, certain changes happen within cells
circuit ramp activity make likely active.
whether not neural circuit neurons within become active less
active context homeostatic plasticity largely depends one mechanism,
beautiful mechanism make clear right now, even don't
background biology. Neurons communicate one another releasing so-
called neurotransmitters, just chemicals. neurotransmitters vomited
out, not actually vomited, spit so-called synaptic cleft,
often called synapse. synapse just little gap neurons.
released synapse, don't just stay there, actually park bind
receptors called postsynaptic neuron. depending many
receptors bind many receptors available, et cetera, can
greater lesser effect postsynaptic neuron. scenario neurotransmitters
released synapses binding receptors postsynaptic neurons
influencing electrical excitability postsynaptic neurons sits central not just
treatment bipolar disorder, treatments psychiatric conditions
indeed things like neuropathic pain well. example, so-called SSRIs, Prozac,
Zoloft others, et cetera, stands selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
mean? Well, serotonin neurotransmitter. actually neuromodulator
released synapse, SSRI, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
allows serotonin sit within synapse longer, re-uptake


inhibitor, prevents re-uptake presynaptic neuron. serotonin therefore
can park dock receptors, called, postsynaptic neuron greater
numbers, greater impact postsynaptic neuron. drugs
used treat depression things sort, things like SSRIs, work changing
availability neurotransmitter synapse. things like MAO inhibitors,
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work different way. inhibit enzyme. Anytime
hear ase biology, likely enzyme breaks things down. MAO
inhibitors prevent breakdown, not re-uptake, breakdown
neurotransmitter therefore allow neurotransmitter available

mechanism makes sure neural circuits never active quiet
long. beautiful display treatments can lead better understanding
biology, can lead discovery even better treatments, lithium another
compound, talk about, ketamine seem exert actions largely
effects homeostatic neuroplasticity. wonderful paper describes
nitty-gritty this. Certainly people listening, guessing, not going
interested detail, want delve deep
this, paper published Neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
titled, Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity Treatment Mood Disorders.
one particular figure paper just describe measurements
made neurons number receptors neurons, done
somewhat indirectly method detailed neuroscientists familiar
with. Basically measures excited given neuron is, electrically excited
given neuron given amount neurotransmitter. amount
neurotransmitter vomited onto neuron essentially kept constant,
response postsynaptic neuron measured. can one level higher
lower depending homeostatic plasticity. paper shows
shown again, neurons exposed lithium period
time, reduction excitability postsynaptic neuron, neurons
within brain become less excitable time lithium present, whereas ketamine,
now common FDA-approved, least US, approved
treatment major depression, ketamine opposite. Ketamine seems increase
number receptors postsynaptic neuron lead greater levels
excitability electrical activity within neural circuits given fixed amount
neurotransmitter. super interesting means lithium
causing circuits less active, ketamine causing circuits active.
know excellent clinical data now ketamine seems effective
treatment major depression, major depressive episodes people
suffer bipolar depression, includes major depressive episodes two
weeks longer suppressed mood, appetite, sleep issues, et cetera. Now, key
thing ketamine often not discussed effects potent,

really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.

financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing

person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release

problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric

not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people

yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture
treatments, drug treatments, talk therapy treatments, lifestyle treatments,

especially online communities, not clear particularly

important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural

ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug

combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar

excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,
many people problem. often associated

probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases

treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright

everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting

particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture
treatments, drug treatments, talk therapy treatments, lifestyle treatments,
nutraceutical, can say supplement-based treatments omega-3
supplementation full necessary picture

next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression

really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often

example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship

recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive

financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing

depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create

person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way

relayed me, may help sleep certain people

not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people

statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things

will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells

like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes

little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3

membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk

three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way

probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases

treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment

approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous

support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting

particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things

will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really

inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like

changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity

Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy

based early, early discussion constitutes bipolar 1 bipolar 2. Now
like also talk not typical therapeutics bipolar disorder
also point things tried failed successful treatment
bipolar disorder, things often talked suggested,
especially online communities, not clear particularly
hazardous own, although carry hazards, think
important critical time sensitive nature bipolar disorder
urgency getting treatments early try prevent longer lasting neural
circuit changes people can avoid less effective demonstrated
ineffective treatments, stand combat bipolar disorder much
successfully. First all, key point drug therapies versus non-drug therapies
talk therapies, without question, drug therapies going effective done
also talk therapies. talk talk therapies
demonstrated effective. argument say
next, general, psychiatrists will tell you, certainly ones spoken


told me, talk therapy rarely, ever effective bipolar depression
bipolar disorder, whether not BP-I BP-II. just reality it. Contrast
discussion obsessive-compulsive disorder, talked
episodes ago, haven't seen episode, in-depth episode
OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. seems drug
therapies talk therapies can done independently combination. expected,
combined drug talk therapies effective either one alone,
pretty impressive effects talk therapy alone provided initiated
right time, right form talk therapy. OCD, terms bipolar
disorder, really seems drug therapies necessary, least cases.
said, talk therapies terrific augment support drug therapies
sometimes can allow people take lower doses drug therapies, turns
important side effect profiles lot drug therapies
sometimes cost well. guess can think cost just another side effect
really. established novel forms talk therapy used,
again, concert drug treatments bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy
one seems best, least way statistics papers exist.
also one explored most. one reasons often
considered popular effective 'cause also around longer
explored most. Cognitive behavioral therapy general progressive
exposure patient controlled way, clinical setting,
triggers conditions exacerbate bipolar disorder. Now, earlier said
borderline personality disorder triggers triggered elements
external environment, whereas bipolar disorder not. still true,
case somebody bipolar can worse symptoms life conditions get worse
stressful. cognitive behavioral therapy, mean discussion
sometimes direct exposure anxiety provoking elements life can helpful
adjusting responses otherwise triggering events sometimes making
drug treatments effective even lower doses. also forms therapy
including family-focused therapy, especially important terms bipolar
disorder family members, provided not manic
episode due close heritability bipolar disorder, family members can often
excellent windows whether not somebody well poorly, veering
toward emerging manic depressive episode understand


person, lot data, purely subjective data, lot
exposure long well somebody's sleeping eating, et cetera. family-
focused therapy involves members person suffering bipolar disorder's
family, well conversations family members way helps patients
bipolar disorder navigate, not just manic episodes depressive episodes,
start learn predict conditions psychological, physical, otherwise
can trigger bipolar episodes. category therapy called
interpersonal social rhythm therapy. deserving entire episode
really. Interpersonal social rhythm therapy, sort expansion family-
focused therapy, although distinct certain ways well, really focuses
people relating others life, workplace, school
environment, also within family, et cetera. say overall theme
emerging psychiatry psychology start wherever possible incorporate
social aspects interpersonal aspects. words, not just talking
examining patient one biological system, one nervous system, one set
chemicals, one life, rather set chemicals, neural circuits, life
embedded chemicals neural circuits lives people. Just way
example, can imagine somebody healthy relationship
abusive relationship, going strongly impact outcomes manic
episodes. can imagine financial situation one people can
recover manic episodes, didn't mention earlier, have, forgive me,
oftentimes people manic episode will go spend immense
amounts money simply cannot afford lose. depressive
episodes that, many cases, follow made far worse financial anxiety
financial stress results manic episodes spending, et cetera.
course, carries sexual promiscuity people might dealing
unwanted pregnancy STIs, fractured interpersonal dynamics existing
new relationships. mean, can imagine manic episodes, well
depressive episodes can really wick enormous amount destruction,
brings us back initial criteria BP-1 BP-2 manic episodes
not good thing. depressive episodes not good thing. create
sense euphoria person experiencing mania, create sense
anything possible. end day, actually every day, episodes
quite maladaptive. really destroy people's lives. not just life


person suffering bipolar disorder. hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-focused therapy interpersonal social rhythm therapies primary
three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew
Cuckoo's Nest, final scene near final scene movie Jack Nicholson
sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type
seizure patient's brain nervous system. might ask, well, one
want that? Well, turns well-established, many cases,
effective treatment major depression. Electric shock therapy generally used
treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows
neuroplasticity take place. Again, BDNF permissive neuroplasticity.
problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way
described quite invasive, right? something need go
hospital oftentimes inpatient care required electric
convulsive therapy. fairly high cost, especially don't insurance.
course requires anesthesia. people, not going problem,
many people problem. often associated
memory loss. memory loss, invasive nature ECT cost


oftentimes rule ECT patients, sort late stage kind
last resort type thing treatment-resistant depression. Nowadays ketamine type
therapy done repeatedly treatments, instance, transcranial magnetic
stimulation basically non-invasive, coil placed outside
skull, excuse me. can accurately refer repetitive rTMS, repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation tool allows
researchers clinicians reduce amount activity specific neural circuits.
can actually target magnetic field particular neural circuits reduce activity
neural circuits. Again, minimally invasive. shown effective
increasing neuroplasticity positive ways, well reducing depressive episodes
instances reducing amplitude intensity manic episodes
people bipolar disorder. problem still early technique. aren't
lot clinics labs it. starting see advertisements, literally
commercial clinics advertising rTMS TMS. encourage approach
clinics caution. mind clinics not either closely maybe
even distantly associated research institution really latest rTMS,
wise least research, explore, talk patients who've
done treatments, certainly university hospitals clinical settings
research settings, rTMS used way to, instance, reduce activity
certain limbic circuitries people just overall less excitable manic
activate can also used activation now certain neural circuits.
Activate, instance, parietal inputs, top control limbic system.
happening right now. ECT, repetitive TMS rTMS,
mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies, targeted toward depressive
aspects manic depression. people bipolar disorder doesn't include
depression, going less effective, overall, going talk
therapies sort discussed earlier, moment ago. Plus drug treatments,
almost always lithium will explored,

01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis

plus treatments depressive episodes particular depressive
episodes present. Nowadays, lot excitement psilocybin
psychedelic. US, psilocybin still illegal. not legal, meaning can get


lot trouble possessing it, certainly selling it, et cetera. psilocybin
explored clinical therapy certain laboratory settings particular, Johns
Hopkins School Medicine. explored human patients treatment
major depression, OCD believe well, certainly major depression
eating disorders. seems initial wave publications work done
incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes
bipolar. However, least knowledge, again, knowledge, not
controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis
treatment bipolar disorder, per se, data supporting use psilocybin
treatment bipolar disorder per se. realize, say that, going
number people may positive negative experiences
cannabis psilocybin relate bipolar disorder. please, willing
comfortable, put that, comfortable, comment section YouTube.


course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive
outcomes treatment bipolar disorder, please provide links PubMed ideas
those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited
context. marching description two compounds, fact
even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said
written relayed expert psychiatrists.

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture
treatments, drug treatments, talk therapy treatments, lifestyle treatments,
nutraceutical, can say supplement-based treatments omega-3
supplementation full necessary picture

02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity

dealing illness. remiss, however, didn't emphasize omega-
3 fatty acid supplementation interesting, not just terms subjective effects,
people saying feel less depressed able sleep better, maybe even
reduction manic symptoms, actually really good brain imaging

talk little bit word, disorder, theme doesn't just relate
bipolar disorder, psychiatric disorders well. think disorder,
think something really detrimental us. Something really impairs

However, idea things like bipolar disorder, even things like

creative works observed carried human beings many
centuries. believe not, good data support fact certain

Huberman Lab Podcast, certainly will conversation.
meantime, like just briefly touch upon idea certain occupations

substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture
treatments, drug treatments, talk therapy treatments, lifestyle treatments,
nutraceutical, can say supplement-based treatments omega-3
supplementation full necessary picture

talk little bit word, disorder, theme doesn't just relate
bipolar disorder, psychiatric disorders well. think disorder,
think something really detrimental us. Something really impairs

However, idea things like bipolar disorder, even things like
schizophrenia cases responsible creative aspects
creative works observed carried human beings many
centuries. believe not, good data support fact certain

episode creativity, neural circuit basis, chemical basis
Huberman Lab Podcast, certainly will conversation.
meantime, like just briefly touch upon idea certain occupations

not poet going give mania, certainly not saying that, not

depression people depression mania seem gravitate towards poetry
least successful poetry. Again, associative, correlative, no causal
relationship here. really striking see creative occupations, poetry,
fiction, art, non-fiction writing, even though non-fiction writing non-fiction, still
creative, music composition, theater, much higher incidents things like mania. fact,
people theater, actors, even though overall occurrence depression
mania lower poets, fraction individuals mania
exceedingly high. 30% looked actors, manic

extremely maladaptive, much, much higher instance suicide, et cetera,
wrong say certain aspects manic episodes don't lend well

creativity performing arts poetry. said, no way, shape form,
believe depressed good thing manic good thing. Again,
return basic foundational criteria bipolar disorder, major depression

three talk therapies often combined drug therapies order try
really reduce harm.

01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

really harm reduction manic episodes depressive episodes. One
exciting emerging treatment show great promise, cases,
great outcomes, bipolar disorder is, believe not electric shock therapy. Electric
shock therapy may sound barbaric, fact, tends look barbaric, although
done controlled setting hospital. seen One Flew

sort bite protector mouth getting electric shock therapy,
name suggests, kind inducing global seizure, either low level grand mal type

treatment-resistant depression. people no positive response
ongoing positive response drug therapies therapies. Electric shock therapy
thought work primarily stimulating massive kind indiscriminate release
things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, huge variety neuromodulators,
well things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor allows

problem ECT really useful treatment-resistant depression,
doesn't actually target manic aspects bipolar depression bipolar disorder,
nonetheless, used drug treatments don't work. negatives electric
shock therapy electric convulsive therapy, ECT, proper acronym way

probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA

hence used try calm people allow sleep

truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,

shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every

stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly

incredible Matthew Johnson Dr. Matthew Johnson, guest
podcast before, also Tim Ferris Podcast, Lex Fridman
Podcast. Dr. Matthew Johnson came podcast, talked
work psilocybin treatment depression. impressive results there.
can imagine, impressive results major depressive episodes
bipolar. However, least knowledge, again, knowledge, not
controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin mania associated
bipolar disorder. someone aware clinical trials, please let
know. update future podcast, right now, no knowledge
psilocybin clinical trials manic component bipolar disorder. number people
probably also going wonder whether not cannabis medical marijuana
useful bipolar disorder. address this, looked previous lectures
clinicians Stanford Psychiatry. question asked them, turns
out, cannabis not seem effective treatment manic phases
bipolar disorder treatment major depressive component.
treatment perhaps, say situation perhaps might useful,
relayed me, may help sleep certain people
trouble insomnia, though nowadays, far common people
manic episodes prescribed things like Trazodone benzos,
benzodiazepines order try get sleep within manic episodes.
benzodiazepines Trazodone, et cetera, work largely so-called GABA
system. neurotransmitter causes reductions excitability neurons,
hence used try calm people allow sleep
manic episodes. not lot, essentially no data, supporting use cannabis
treatment bipolar disorder, per se, data supporting use psilocybin
treatment bipolar disorder per se. realize, say that, going
number people may positive negative experiences

course, aware studies cannabis psilocybin showing positive

those, love peruse studies. two naturopathic, say,
nutrition, supplement-based approaches bipolar disorder. get talked lot,
one shows interesting promise, effectiveness even, limited

even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably
something get real detail future episode really
want nerd cell-cell signaling, favorite topic mine. case,
inositol related number so-called second messenger systems, handoff,
kind stimulating changes within cell can inspire changes called
membrane fluidity, can actually make membranes cells, outside fence around
cell, made fatty stuff, can change fluidity, meaning readily
things can float around membrane. know, think cells rigid, like
cell, neuron, immune cell, actually cells
fatty outside, particular neurons fatty outside. thin fatty outside, called
cell membrane, things floating around cell membrane, kind
like jello hasn't quite fixed. things like receptors moving synapse
moving synapse homeostatic plasticity, things like ability certain genes
turned cell not turned on, can depend lot things happening
cell membrane readily things move around cell membrane. One
way think whole picture membrane fluidity just imagine
everyone cells layer, kind gelatinous-like layer lots
little rafts floating around there, rafts able move quickly
one place another, get stuck one place another, depending set
jello is. Inositol lithium, talk next, omega-3 fatty acids seem
change fluidity membranes, words, allow things move
membranes readily not. no surprise given
membranes made fatty stuff. particular, membranes neurons
called lipid bilayer, two layers fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. omega-3
fatty acids sort found certain fish, fatty fish particular,
found fish oil cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, ingest
used lot different things, can readily incorporated
pathways directly incorporated cell membranes, changing way cell
membranes work cell membranes cell membranes neurons,
changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset
effects mania offset effects depressive episodes bipolar disorder.


actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed
treatment approach bipolar disorder. goes back saying
essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
major depressive episodes bipolar. couple studies, link
show notes well, show may even improve
manic episodes well, meaning reduces manic symptoms. Now say
place great caution, know, especially listeners
podcast, lot interest behavioral tools, supplement-based tools,


nutrition tools can support bipolar disorder, don't think can overemphasize
enough especially bipolar disorder great risk suicide suffering
inappropriate spending, say maladaptive spending impulsivity
associated bipolar disorder, hard imagine scenario just talk
therapy fish oil lifestyle interventions going completely suppress treat
bipolar disorder. People bipolar disorder really need consider full picture

dealing illness. remiss, however, didn't emphasize omega-
3 fatty acid supplementation interesting, not just terms subjective effects,
people saying feel less depressed able sleep better, maybe even
reduction manic symptoms, actually really good brain imaging

talk little bit word, disorder, theme doesn't just relate
bipolar disorder, psychiatric disorders well. think disorder,
think something really detrimental us. Something really impairs
ability function work, school, relationships, really starts pull
health status variety ways. certainly bipolar disorder meets criteria.
However, idea things like bipolar disorder, even things like
schizophrenia cases responsible creative aspects
creative works observed carried human beings many
centuries. believe not, good data support fact certain
aspects mania associated creativity. Now, long overdue
episode creativity, neural circuit basis, chemical basis
Huberman Lab Podcast, certainly will conversation.
meantime, like just briefly touch upon idea certain occupations
associated higher incidence bipolar depression. fact, explored


research level. data pointed fact certain individuals certain
occupations tend creative creativity associated with, again,
associated, isn't causal, associated, correlated higher levels incidents
bipolar depression maybe even forms depression. study looking
mood disorders eminent individuals. people not just good
do, exceptional do, explored percentage
people given professions either depression mania. actually data

professional athletes didn't seem have, no incidence mania, least

eminent individuals, people exceptional poets, exceptional fiction
writers, exceptional artists non-fiction writers, well there, especially poets,
find many 90% successful poets either depression mania.
high 90%, incredible. Contrast military 10%
professional athletes 20%, professional athletes,
mentioned before, none mania. mean poet will
make manic depressed? Well, first all, look poetry category. turns
75% eminent poets, highly accomplished poets major
depression, whereas 20% poets manic episodes. again,
not poet going give mania, certainly not saying that, not
poet going give depression, turns people


depression people depression mania seem gravitate towards poetry
least successful poetry. Again, associative, correlative, no causal
relationship here. really striking see creative occupations, poetry,
fiction, art, non-fiction writing, even though non-fiction writing non-fiction, still
creative, music composition, theater, much higher incidents things like mania. fact,
people theater, actors, even though overall occurrence depression
mania lower poets, fraction individuals mania
exceedingly high. 30% looked actors, manic
episodes full blown mania. referring data first all,
find incredibly interesting, right now talking bipolar
disorder mood disorders maladaptive effects. again,
extremely maladaptive, much, much higher instance suicide, et cetera,
wrong say certain aspects manic episodes don't lend well
creativity certain aspects major depression don't lend well
creativity performing arts poetry. said, no way, shape form,
believe depressed good thing manic good thing. Again,
return basic foundational criteria bipolar disorder, major depression
pressured speech, not sleeping, incredible increases energy
flights ideas generally not going lead, think fair say, not going
lead good places. fact, often lead bad places. also wrong
didn't consider fact somewhat inextricable relationship mania

Nowadays, common hear people saying, ah, know, person OCD.
Well, episode OCD weeks back, can find like
hubermanlab.com, episode, pointed OCD, obsessive-compulsive

even mentioning two compounds, want emphasize said

01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids

not wise rely purely talk therapy natural approaches treatment
bipolar disorder given intensity disorder high propensity suicide risk
people bipolar disorder, chemical neural circuit disruption, needs
dealt head appropriate chemistry prescription drug
approaches board-certified psychiatrist. don't say protect me, say
truly protect either suffer think may suffer bipolar disorder
know someone think might suffer bipolar disorder. Now,
not say aren't useful lifestyle interventions can support people
bipolar disorder. just briefly want mention those. again, lifting
statements make excellent online lectures psychiatrists
Stanford elsewhere, essentially say that, course, course, course,
getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, quality,
healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight day avoiding bright
light night, things going braid together support nervous
system psyche somebody bipolar disorder, braid together
support psyche neurochemistry neural circuits anybody
everybody. generally modulatory effect indirectly shifting
likelihood somebody might episode, intensity episode,
particular, depressive episodes. can imagine someone heading
depressive episode, maybe lower amount medication haven't
yet medicated depressive episode bipolar. now making sure
family making sure getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera. course makes perfect sense perhaps


shallower drop depression maybe offset depressive episode. said,
all, not people bipolar disorder likely need sort drug
therapy intervention order help them. lifestyle factors always important
individuals, suffering psychiatric conditions not. conditions
mind body, lifestyle interventions can greater effect offsetting
symptoms, whereas bipolar disorder, think naive, fact, wrong say
lifestyle interventions alone going prevent, especially extreme forms mania
depression. Again, bipolar disorder serious carrying high suicide
risk, just point again. Now said, two
substances generally found supplements, although sources
well, including within nutritional sources shown, least
studies, pretty effective adjusting symptoms bipolar disorder,
two things inositol omega-3 fatty acids. Now inositol compound taken
variety reasons. something talked podcast before.
personally take inositol not bipolar disorder, fact quite lucky
don't bipolar disorder, take inositol, 900 milligrams myo-inositol every
third night order improve sleep. something added sleep
stack. something found greatly enhances depth quality sleep.
wake middle night use bathroom, et cetera, greatly
enhanced ability fall back asleep want go back sleep. also seems
fairly potent anti-anxiety effect day. discussed episode
obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol used high dosages, again,
say myo-inositol used high dosages, levels even 10, 18 grams,
massive dosages way, deal certain symptoms OCD limited
success. mention high dosages 10 18 grams inositol can cause
lot gastric discomfort, et cetera. want learn inositol
various uses, encourage go examine.com so-called Human
Effect Matrix, Human Effects Matrix will describe many places myo-
inositol forms inositol show shown effective in, instance,
reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep on. Myo-inositol important
myo-inositol, can just say inositol, related so-called second messenger
pathways. don't want get deep second messenger pathways,
certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters receptor cell surface, oftentimes
receptors will open allow passage ions things


cell. Oftentimes will engage called second messenger systems
will trigger mechanisms within cell go things. probably

changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil

double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed

essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms

changing way neurons work. ability fish oil, particular,
omega-3 fatty acids, come varieties like EPA DHA, talk
moment, explored relatively high dosages ability offset

actually, data pretty impressive, although, although varied,
meaning will find several studies, mention few, found no effect
omega-3 supplementation fish oil, usually capsuled fish oil, although fish oil
can also taken, excuse me, liquid form. Oftentimes taking liquid form
cost efficient way it. Taking capsule form palatable way it,
fish oil lot people doesn't taste good. nonetheless, several
studies shown supplementing fish oil omega-3 fatty acids levels
of, instance, four grams per day period time, study will link
show notes, Murphy al. 2012. fatty acid supplementation 70%
EPA DHA actually worsen symptoms mania period 16 weeks,
face makes seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
likely not good bipolar disorder. yet manic phase. one
looks studies omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, is,
instance, study published 1999, much higher dosage supplementation
omega-3 fatty acid, 9.6 grams fish oil per day four months.
actually greatly reduced symptoms bipolar depression compared control group
received olive oil, olive oil different form fat, monounsaturated fat
doesn't contain much omega-3 fatty acids forth. 9.6 grams fish oil
per day four months lot fish oil ingesting given day.
double blind study. carried out, mention, 30 subjects,
males females. age range pretty broad, anywhere 18 way
64 years age, important given sort longitudinal changes
time, one sees bipolar disorder. major takeaway, supplementing
high dose omega-3s seem beneficial good number people
bipolar disorder. However, again, want highlight, however, not viewed

essential need, every case, high potency prescription drug
treatments prescribed board certified psychiatrists bipolar disorder. However,
omega-3 supplementation seem improve reduce depressive symptoms
